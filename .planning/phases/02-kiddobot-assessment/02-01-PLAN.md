# Phase 2 Plan 01: Internal Link Cleanup

## Overview

Fix 66 malformed markdown internal links being parsed as URLs. These are relative path references (`../path/file.md`) and local file references (`County.md`) that got incorrectly formatted with `https://` prefixes.

## Scope

**Issue Count:** 66 broken "URLs" (actually internal links)
**Files Affected:** ~15 markdown files in KiddoBot knowledge base
**Pattern Types:**
- Relative paths: `https://../01_Subsidies/...` (43 instances)
- Local file refs: `https://San_Diego_County.md` (21 instances)
- CSV file refs: `https://APP_Directory.csv` (2 instances)

## Tasks

### 1. Identify affected files

```bash
grep -r "https://\.\." kiddobot/ChildCareAssessment/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
grep -rE "https://[A-Za-z_]+\.md" kiddobot/ChildCareAssessment/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
```

### 2. Fix relative path links

Transform: `[text](https://../folder/file.md)` → `[text](../folder/file.md)`

Pattern to search/replace:
- Remove `https://` prefix from relative paths
- Ensure paths resolve correctly

### 3. Fix local file references

Transform: `[text](https://County_Name.md)` → `[text](County_Name.md)`

Common patterns:
- County deep dive cross-references
- Subsidy program cross-references
- Application process cross-references

### 4. Validate fixes

Run URL validator on affected files only to confirm no new broken links introduced.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero internal links being parsed as external URLs
- [ ] All cross-references between KiddoBot knowledge files work
- [ ] URL validator shows 66 fewer "broken URLs"

## Estimated Duration

15-20 minutes (mostly grep/sed operations)

## Depends On

Nothing - can run first

## Notes

This is a cleanup task, not URL remediation. The content is correct; the markdown formatting is wrong.
