### Skip (Bot Protected) - 6 URLs
- ftb.ca.gov/* - All FTB URLs return 403 (bot protection)

## Tasks

### 1. Research CDE URL updates
- Visit www.cde.ca.gov/sp/cd/ section
- Find current URLs for child development programs
- Document new paths

### 2. Verify DDS site status
- Check if DDS site is temporarily down or restructured
- If temporary, may need to skip and revalidate later

### 3. Update CDSS/DSS URLs
- cdss.ca.gov has moved to new structure
- CCLD search is now at ccld.dss.ca.gov/carefacilitysearch

### 4. Fix CHHS data portal links
- data.chhs.ca.gov uses authentication
- May need to link to landing pages instead of direct downloads

### 5. Fix CA.gov generic links
- ca.gov/disability should be edd.ca.gov/en/disability
- mychildcare.ca.gov needs www prefix

### 6. Apply fixes to affected files

### 7. Validate fixes

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CDE URLs updated to current paths
- [ ] DDS URLs either fixed or marked for later (if site down)
- [ ] CDSS/DSS URLs updated
- [ ] CHHS data links functional
- [ ] CA.gov URLs corrected
- [ ] FTB URLs left as-is (known bot protection)

## Estimated Duration

30-45 minutes

## Depends On

02-01-PLAN (internal link cleanup) should run first to reduce noise

## Notes

DDS site (dds.ca.gov) returning 502 errors may indicate temporary issues. If site appears down, document and skip for later verification.
