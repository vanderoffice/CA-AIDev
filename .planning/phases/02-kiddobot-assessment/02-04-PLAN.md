# Phase 2 Plan 04: Nonprofit & Resource Organization URL Fixes

## Overview

Triage and fix 73 nonprofit/resource organization URLs. Many are small child care resource organizations that may have changed domains, gone offline, or have SSL/DNS issues.

## Scope

**Issue Count:** 73 URLs
**Error Types:**
- 0 Connection Error: ~50 (DNS/SSL/timeout)
- 403 Forbidden: ~12 (bot protection)
- 404 Not Found: ~8 (moved/gone)
- 405 Method Not Allowed: ~2 (server config)
- 502 Bad Gateway: ~1

## Triage Categories

### Category A: Known Good Orgs (verify & fix)
Large, established organizations likely still active:
- naeyc.org (National Association for Education of Young Children)
- ymca.org
- bgca.org (Boys & Girls Clubs)
- first5california.com
- headstartca.org

### Category B: California-specific orgs (research)
- childrencouncil.org (SF Children's Council)
- rcoe.us (Riverside County Office of Ed)
- ccrcca.org (CA Child Care Resource Center)
- qualitycountsca.net (Quality Counts CA)

### Category C: Small local R&Rs (may be defunct)
Resource & Referral agencies by county - many small orgs:
- valleyoakcs.org
- delnortechildcare.org
- lassencfr.org
- iceschildcare.org
- sncs.org
- family-resource.org
- sbfamilycare.org
- cdrc-childcare.org
- trintyfamilyresource.org (note: likely typo for "trinity")

### Category D: Out-of-state/federal (skip or replace)
- texas.gov/programs/child-care (wrong state, remove)
- hhs.gov/* (federal, often blocked)
- census.gov/* (federal, check alternatives)

### Category E: Bot-protected (skip)
- lacity.gov
- kidsdata.org
- cchealth.org
- winnie.com

## Tasks

### 1. Verify Category A organizations (10 min)
Test each with www prefix and without. Update to working URLs.

### 2. Research Category B California orgs (15 min)
- Find current URLs for established CA child care organizations
- These are likely just DNS/www issues

### 3. Triage Category C local R&Rs (20 min)
For each small org:
1. Check if org still exists (quick web search)
2. If yes, find current URL
3. If defunct, either:
   - Remove reference if not critical
   - Replace with county R&R directory link
   - Mark with note that org may have closed

### 4. Handle Category D federal/out-of-state (5 min)
- Remove texas.gov reference (wrong state)
- For HHS/federal sites, link to landing pages not deep links
- For census.gov, link to main geocoder page

### 5. Skip Category E bot-protected
Note these as "403 - bot protection" and leave as-is.

### 6. Apply fixes to affected files

### 7. Validate fixes

## Files Likely Affected

- 07_County_Deep_Dives/All_58_Counties_RR_Directory.md (most R&R links)
- 02_Provider_Search/School_Age_Programs.md
- 01_Subsidies/CalWORKs/county_variations/*.md
- Various other topic files

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Category A orgs all have working URLs
- [ ] Category B CA orgs updated
- [ ] Category C defunct orgs documented/removed
- [ ] Category D out-of-state refs cleaned up
- [ ] Category E noted as bot-protected
- [ ] Net reduction of ~50+ broken URLs

## Estimated Duration

45-60 minutes (most time-consuming plan due to manual research)

## Depends On

02-01, 02-02, 02-03 (run those first to reduce overall count)

## Notes

The All_58_Counties_RR_Directory.md file likely contains most of the small R&R org links. Consider whether this file needs restructuring if many orgs are defunct.

Some orgs may have merged, renamed, or been absorbed by larger organizations. Document any findings for future reference.
