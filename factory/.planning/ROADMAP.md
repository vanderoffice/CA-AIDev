# Roadmap: Government Automation Factory

## Overview

Build a factory — skills, templates, and scripts — that standardizes the path from "new government domain" to "deployed on vanderdev.net." Start with the RAG pipeline foundation, then build scaffolding, research, n8n, and frontend layers in parallel, wire up deploy automation, and finish with the top-level orchestrator that ties everything into one command.
