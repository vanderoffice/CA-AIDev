    "comment_text": "The proposed regulation violates the Clean Air Act Section 112(b) by failing to adequately address hazardous air pollutants from industrial sources. According to EPA's own 2023 data, particulate matter emissions in our region exceed safe levels by 40%. The regulation must be strengthened to comply with federal law and protect public health."

    "comment_text": "The traffic impact study is fundamentally flawed. The study uses outdated 2019 traffic models and fails to account for the 25% increase in vehicle volume documented by the Department of Transportation in 2024. Additionally, the noise impact analysis contradicts peer-reviewed research published in the Journal of Urban Planning (Smith et al., 2023) which demonstrates that similar projects increase ambient noise levels by 15-20 decibels."

    "comment_text": "This rule violates patients' rights under HIPAA and conflicts with state medical privacy statutes (Health Code Section 56.10). The proposed data sharing provisions lack adequate safeguards and do not comply with the minimum necessary standard required by 45 CFR 164.502(b). Our organization strongly opposes this regulation as currently written."

    "comment_text": "The watershed protection plan ignores recent scientific findings on groundwater contamination. Studies from the U.S. Geological Survey (2024) show that PFAS levels in local aquifers are 10 times higher than previously estimated. The regulation should incorporate updated EPA guidance on emerging contaminants and require quarterly rather than annual monitoring. The proposed standards are insufficient given current scientific understanding of long-term exposure risks."
