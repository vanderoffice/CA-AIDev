# Alternative Financing Mechanisms

This document covers innovative financing mechanisms for California water infrastructure beyond traditional grants, including environmental impact bonds, green bonds, public-private partnerships, water markets, and pay-for-success models.

## Environmental Impact Bonds (EIBs)

Environmental Impact Bonds link investor returns directly to environmental outcomes, representing a revolutionary departure from traditional municipal bond financing.

### How EIBs Work

**Basic Structure:**
1. Private investors provide upfront capital
2. Funds transfer to project implementer
3. Environmental intervention produces outcomes
4. Beneficiaries reimburse costs plus interest based on performance
5. Interest rate can be predetermined or performance-based

**Key Distinction from Green Bonds:**
- Green bonds: Fixed repayment regardless of project performance
- EIBs: Compensation indexed to forecasted and realized environmental benefits

**Repayment Sources:**
- Cost savings (reduced cleanup costs, more efficient regulatory compliance)
- Financial benefits (reduced flooding, enhanced revenues, increased tax base)

### DC Water: America's First EIB (Model Case Study)

**Background:**
- Combined sewer overflows dumped 2.5 billion gallons annually into DC rivers
- 2005 EPA consent decree required addressing sewer overflow
- Initial plan: Multi-billion dollar grey infrastructure

**EIB Structure:**

### Accessing EIB Financing

**Critical First Steps:**
1. Quantify environmental outcomes with investor-grade precision
2. Develop clear performance metrics
3. Establish monitoring protocols and third-party evaluation

**Key Partners Needed:**
- Engineers (project design, monitoring protocols)

## Green Bonds for Water Infrastructure

Green bonds are fixed-income securities with proceeds earmarked for environmentally beneficial projects.

### Green Bond Principles (GBP)

**Four Core Components:**
1. **Use of Proceeds:** Clear description in legal documentation
2. **Project Evaluation and Selection:** Process for identifying eligible projects
3. **Management of Proceeds:** Tracking and allocation systems
4. **Reporting:** Transparency on project implementation and impact

### Climate Bonds Standard

The Climate Bonds Initiative provides independent verification for water infrastructure bonds:

**Coverage:**
- Built (grey) water infrastructure
- Natural (green or hybrid) water infrastructure
- Industrial water efficiency and reuse
- Catchment/watershed restoration
- Large-scale water supply development

### San Francisco PUC: Leading California Green Bond Issuer

### Accessing Green Bond Funding

**State Bond Process:**
1. Legislature proposes bond measures
2. Voters approve during elections
3. State sells debt in capital markets
4. Proceeds placed into specified funds
5. State agencies distribute grants to communities

**Key Distributing Agencies:**

## Water Markets and Trading

California water markets enable trading of water rights and supplies between willing buyers and sellers.

### California Surface Water Market

**Evolution:**
- Began in early 1980s
- Expanded significantly during 1987-1992 drought
- State-run Drought Water Bank spurred development

**Current Scale:**
- Approximately 1.5 million acre-feet traded annually
- About 4% of all water used by cities and farms

**Transaction Geography:**
- 46% within same county
- 26% within same region

**Transaction Types:**
- Short-term transfers (drought-year purchases)
- Long-term bilateral agreements
- Water banks and pools (intermediary arrangements)
- Multi-party transfers

**Participants:**
- Farms hold ~4x more water rights than cities (primary sellers)
- Growing cities are major buyers (especially San Joaquin Valley, Southern California)
- Southern California cities now receive ~15% of supplies from trades

### Environmental Water Purchases

- Over 6 million acre-feet acquired for environmental purposes (1982-2019)
- 17% of total market flows
- Supports wildlife refuges, fish flows, Salton Sea salt reduction
- Funding from state/federal taxpayers and water users

### Groundwater Trading and SGMA

**Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA):**
- Requires Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) to develop sustainability plans
- Creates framework for groundwater trading programs

**How Groundwater Trading Works:**
1. Pumpers receive allocations (allowances to extract specific amounts)
2. Pumpers can use allocation individually or trade with others
3. Users implementing conservation create tradeable surplus
4. Market creates flexibility for constrained areas

**GSA Authority:**
- Developing trading programs is voluntary and locally driven
- GSAs best positioned for local context
- Responsible for protecting vulnerable users (natural resources, small farms, disadvantaged communities)

### Mojave Basin Groundwater Market

**Most Liquid California Groundwater Market:**
- Established through 1990s court adjudication
- Over $400 million in economic gains from adjudication

**Market Characteristics:**
- Alto subarea: Highest trading activity and prices
- Baja subarea: Second-highest volume
- Spot market volume exceeded 20,000 acre-feet since 1990s

**Participants:**
- Agriculture
- Recreational lake operators
- Industrial operations (mining, cement)
- Environmental interests
- Mojave Water Agency (addressing overdraft)
- California Department of Fish and Wildlife (habitat protection)

### Groundwater Banking

**Metropolitan Water District Example:**
- Increased groundwater storage capacity 13x since 1990
- Partnerships along State Water Project and Colorado River Aqueduct
- In dry years: Partners pump stored water or provide exchange supplies

**Antelope Valley-East Kern High Desert Water Bank:**
- Storage capacity: Up to 280 acre-feet
- Dry-year supply: Up to 50 acre-feet
- MWD funded monitoring/production wells, turnouts, pipelines, recharge basins

### Groundwater Sustainability Fees

**Santa Rosa Plain GSA Example:**
- Self-funded through groundwater sustainability fee
- 2024-2025 Rate: $43.65 per acre-foot
- Rural residential (0.5 acre-feet/year): $21.83 annual fee

## Pay-for-Success Models

Pay-for-Success (PFS) contracting defines desired outcomes and restructures payments to align with results achieved.

### How PFS Works

**Basic Structure:**
1. Private investors fund initial project costs
2. Service providers implement on-the-ground work
3. Independent evaluator assesses performance
4. Beneficiaries reimburse investors based on outcomes

**Key Benefits:**
- Increases likelihood of achieving desired outcomes
- Documents return on investment clearly
- Informs future funding decisions
- Shifts risk to private sector

### Water Sector PFS Applications

**Clean Water Commerce Act (2017, expanded 2021):**
- Authorized through 2030
- Purchases $20 million/year in nitrogen reduction outcomes
- Units of environmental improvement paid for after production
- Cuts paperwork, increases competition, drives down costs

**Maryland Cross-State Innovation:**
- $25 million transfer to Susquehanna River Basin Commission
- Purchases nitrogen reduction outcomes in either state's watershed
- First time Maryland spent state money on projects in another state

### Anne Arundel County PFS Program (2018)

**Full Delivery of Water Quality Improvements:**
- Expedites waterway restoration through public-private partnerships
- Funds stormwater Best Management Practice construction
- Supports NPDES MS4 permit goals, Chesapeake Bay TMDL, Clean Water Act

**How It Works:**
1. Contractors front initial implementation costs
2. County reimburses after construction and verification
3. Projects verified to generate water quality credits
4. Competitive proposals prioritized by readiness

**Results:**
- Resilient, cost-effective project pipeline
- Significantly cheaper than previous traditional contracts
- Substantial progress toward permit requirements

### North Carolina: PFS Pioneer

**Division of Mitigation Services In-Lieu Fee Programs:**
- Purchases environmental outcomes for responsible development
- Watershed approach maximizes environmental returns
- Aggregates funding from permittees needing to offset impacts
- Creates larger, more beneficial restoration than one-off projects

### Accessing PFS Financing

**Business Case Requirements:**
- Clear identification of project impacts and benefiting stakeholders
- Benefits outweigh costs
- Willingness to pay for ecosystem services delivered
- Payors able to repay investors
- Service providers with capacity and expertise
- Reasonable completion timeline

**Key Steps:**
1. Develop robust outcome quantification
2. Establish third-party verification mechanisms
3. Structure flexible repayment (below-market initially, ramps up with performance)
4. Engage experienced PFS transaction developers
