# Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM) Funding

The Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM) program is California's primary collaborative approach to regional water management, providing over $2 billion in state funding since 2002 to implement more than 1,450 integrated, multi-benefit water projects statewide.

## Program Overview

IRWM encourages water agencies across watersheds to collaborate in managing regional water resources rather than operating in isolation. The program provides funding for implementation projects that:

- Support coordinated regional water management
- Set regional priorities for water infrastructure investment
- Improve regional self-reliance
- Reduce dependence on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta

Communities receiving IRWM grants have matched state funding at an average ratio of **2.5:1**, mobilizing over $5 billion when combined with local contributions.

## Regional Structure

### Coverage
- 48 officially accepted IRWM regions
- 87% of California's land area
- 99% of state population

### Funding Areas
California is divided into 12 hydrologic region-based Funding Areas for Proposition 1 grants:

- North Coast
- Sacramento Valley
- San Francisco Bay
- Central Coast
- South Coast
- Colorado River
- (and 6 additional regional areas)

Some areas have **Funding Area Coordinating Committees (FACCs)** to manage distribution across multiple IRWM regions (e.g., Tri-County FACC for San Diego Funding Area).

## Regional Water Management Groups (RWMGs)

Each IRWM region operates through an RWMG that:

- Develops and adopts the regional IRWM Plan
- Coordinates stakeholder involvement
- Evaluates and prioritizes projects
- Submits grant applications to DWR

### RWMG Composition
Must include at least three local agencies, with two having statutory authority over water supply/management. Typical members:
- Cities and counties
- Water districts and special districts
- Nonprofit organizations
- Tribal entities
- Environmental groups
- Disadvantaged community representatives

## Types of IRWM Grants

### Planning Grants
- Purpose: Develop or update IRWM Plans
- Funding: Approximately $5M total (modest compared to implementation)
- 2016 awards: $4.2M across 15 proposals
- Activities: Surveys, stakeholder engagement, technical analysis

### Implementation Grants
- Purpose: Construction of water management infrastructure
- Proposition 1 funding: $510M total authorization
- Round 1 (2020): $211M to 42 regions
- Round 2 (2023): $201M to 40 regions
- Total awarded: Over $403M

### DAC Involvement Grants
- Purpose: Engage disadvantaged communities in IRWM planning
- Funding: $51M (10% reservation per Funding Area)
- Activities: Outreach, capacity building, needs assessments

## Eligible Project Types

- Water reuse and recycling (potable and non-potable)
- Water conservation and efficiency
- Surface and underground storage
- Groundwater recharge and cleanup
- Regional water conveyance
- Watershed protection and restoration
- Stormwater and flood management
- Conjunctive use programs
- Water desalination
- Decision support tools
- Water quality improvements

## Disadvantaged Community Requirements

### Definitions
- **DAC**: Median household income <80% statewide MHI ($48,706 threshold)
- **SDAC**: Median household income <60% statewide MHI

### Set-Asides
- Minimum 10% of each Funding Area's allocation reserved for DAC projects
- Round 2: $93M (46%) directed to DAC/tribal benefits

### Match Waivers
For DAC implementation projects seeking Prop 84 or Prop 1 funds:
- Standard 25% match requirement may be **waived entirely**
- Critical for communities with limited financial capacity

## Statewide Priorities

DWR evaluates projects against five statewide priorities:

1. **Natural Infrastructure**: Forests, floodplains, wetlands for sustainable water management
2. **Regional Approaches**: Watershed-level coordination, system interties
3. **Drought Preparedness**: Conservation, recycling, conjunctive use, desalination
4. **Climate Resilience**: Adaptation, greenhouse gas reduction, sea level rise preparation
5. **Partnerships**: Local, federal, tribal collaboration

## Application Process

### Region Acceptance Process (RAP)
Before applying for implementation grants, regions must:
1. Submit documentation of geographic boundaries
2. Demonstrate governance structure
3. Identify Lead Agency
4. Show minimum agency membership

48 regions currently accepted; status maintained unless boundaries change.

### IRWM Plan Requirements
Projects must be explicitly listed in an adopted IRWM Plan consistent with 2016 standards. Plans must address:
- Regional water assessments
- Governance and stakeholder involvement
- Environmental considerations
- Climate change vulnerabilities
- Disadvantaged community strategies

### Implementation Grant Applications

Applications submitted through Proposal Solicitation Packages (PSPs) that specify:
- Evaluation criteria
- Funding priorities
- Maximum grant amounts
- Match requirements
- Application deadlines

Required documentation:
- Detailed work plans
- Line-item budgets
- Environmental review (CEQA)
- Letters of support
- Project schedules
