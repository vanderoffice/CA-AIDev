# SRF Funding for Small Communities

## Community Classification System

### Disadvantaged Community Definitions

|----------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Disadvantaged Community | DAC | ≤80% of statewide MHI | Any |
| Severely Disadvantaged Community | SDAC | ≤60% of statewide MHI | Any |

## Consolidation Support

### Types of Consolidation

**Physical Consolidation:**

- Original water supply and distribution retained
- Local operational control maintained

### Water Partnerships (Alternative to Full Consolidation)
- Shared water source use
- Consolidated billing services
- Joint purchasing agreements
- Shared certified operators
