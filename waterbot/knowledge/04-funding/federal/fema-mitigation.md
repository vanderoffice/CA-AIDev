# FEMA Hazard Mitigation Programs

## Overview

The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers several hazard mitigation grant programs available to water utilities and water-related infrastructure projects. These programs operate under the Stafford Act and support communities in reducing disaster risk through prevention and infrastructure resilience investments.

### Program Ecosystem

| Program | Availability | Type | Primary Focus |
|---------|-------------|------|---------------|
| HMGP | Post-disaster | Formula | Broad mitigation |
| BRIC | Annual (status uncertain) | Competitive | Pre-disaster resilience |
| FMA | Annual | Competitive | Flood-specific |
| PDM | Congressional earmarks | Directed spending | Various |

## Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)

### Program Structure

HMGP is authorized by Section 404 of the Stafford Act and provides grants following presidentially declared disasters. Unlike competitive programs, HMGP is triggered by specific disaster events within defined geographic and temporal windows.

### Cost-Share Requirements

| Community Type | Federal Share | Local Share |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Standard | 75% | 25% |
| Small/Impoverished | Up to 90% | 10% |

- Match can be cash or in-kind (labor, materials)
- Applications due within 1 year of disaster declaration

### Eligible Applicants

- Public utilities
- Private non-profit (PNP) utilities
- Private for-profit (PFP) utilities (if local government submits application)
- Must have projects in FEMA-approved local hazard mitigation plan

### Funding Allocations

- **7%:** Planning projects (hazard mitigation plan development/updates)
- **5%:** Innovative/pilot projects
- **88%:** Construction and implementation

### Eligible Water Projects

**Structural Improvements:**
- Elevation of flood-prone facilities
- Backup power systems at critical facilities
- Seismic retrofitting of pipes and connections
- Culvert enlargement/modification
- Electrical system hardening
- Submersible pump replacements

**Multi-Hazard/Climate Resilience:**
- Green infrastructure
- Floodplain and stream restoration
- Aquifer storage and recovery
- Nature-based solutions

### California Implementation

**Applicant Agent:** Cal OES (California Governor's Office of Emergency Services)

**Application Process:**
1. Contact county Local Mitigation Strategy Working Group (LMSWG)
2. Get project on county priority list
3. Submit Notice of Interest (NOI) through Cal OES Engage Portal
4. If accepted, submit full subapplication
5. Cal OES review (6-12 months)
6. FEMA review (12-24 months)

**Current Opportunities (as of Jan 2026):**
- Rolling NOI acceptance for continuous disasters
- DR-4856 specific deadlines (NOI: May 29, 2025; Subapplication: Sept 15, 2025)

### California Priorities

- Community-wide resilience and adaptation
- Multi-hazard mitigation (wildfire, flood, drought)
- Integrated water resource management
- Groundwater recharge and stormwater diversion
- Innovative/pilot projects

## Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)

### Program Background

BRIC was established through the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 as an annual, pre-disaster competitive program replacing PDM. Through April 2025, BRIC distributed over $5 billion in grants nationwide.

### Cost-Share Structure

| Community Type | Federal Share | Local Share |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Standard | 75% | 25% |
| Small/Impoverished | 90% | 10% |

### California BRIC Projects at Risk

Notable funded/pending projects include:
- City of Riverbank Recycled Water Project: $50 million
- City of Hillsborough Highline Pipeline Project: $23.4 million
- El Dorado Irrigation District Infrastructure Protection: $7 million
- Inland Empire Recycled Water and Aquifer Storage: $46.3 million
- El Dorado Irrigation District Climate Adaptive Infrastructure: $14.6 million

**Total California BRIC projects at risk:** ~$870 million

### Current Status (Critical)

**April 4, 2025:** FEMA terminated BRIC program effective immediately
- All FY 2020-2023 applications canceled
- FY 2024 NOFO ($750 million) canceled
- Undistributed funds returned to Treasury/Disaster Relief Fund

**August 2025:** Federal court temporarily halted fund reallocation
- Judge ruled administration lacked authority to repurpose Congressional funds
- Does not restore funding—prevents misappropriation during litigation

**As of January 2026:** Program remains in legal limbo
- No new funding cycles announced
- Previously awarded projects uncertain

## Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA)

### Program Structure

FMA is funded through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and specifically targets reducing claims against NFIP by funding mitigation for insured structures.

### Key Difference from Other Programs

- Does NOT require disaster declaration
- Available annually through competitive process
- Structures must have NFIP policy at application and maintain through project life

### Cost-Share Structure

| Property Type | Federal Share | Local Share |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Standard | 75% | 25% |
| Repetitive Loss | Up to 90% | 10% |
| Severe Repetitive Loss | Up to 100% | 0% |

### Eligibility Requirements

- Must participate in NFIP (not withdrawn, probation, or suspended)
- NFIP policy in effect at application start
- Insurance maintained through project completion and structure life

### Eligible Water Project Types

- Elevation of water treatment plants, pump stations
- Acquisition and relocation from high-hazard flood areas
- Mitigation reconstruction of flood-damaged facilities
- Dry floodproofing of non-residential facilities
- Small local flood reduction projects

### Funding Levels

- FY 2024: $600 million available
- FY 2023: $800 million available
- Demand vastly exceeds funding (~$8 billion in requests vs. combined BRIC/FMA availability)

### Application Cycle

- NOFOs published July-August annually
- Applications typically due January-April following year
- Submit NOI through Cal OES first
- Cal OES evaluates competitiveness before FEMA submission

## Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)

### Current Status

PDM was replaced by BRIC in 2020 but continues through Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS).

### FY 2024 Authorization

- 110 specific mitigation projects designated by Congress
- Cal OES not involved in selection
- If selected by Congress, Cal OES helps develop subapplications

## Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) Requirements

### Fundamental Requirement

All FEMA mitigation projects must demonstrate cost-effectiveness through BCA showing benefits exceed costs.

### Cost-Effectiveness Threshold

- **Required BCR:** 1.0 or greater (benefits ≥ costs)
- Projects below 1.0 generally ineligible

### Quantifiable Benefits

- Avoided structural damage
- Avoided loss of function/operational disruption
- Avoided injuries and fatalities
- Avoided business interruption
- Avoided emergency response costs
- Avoided equipment replacement
- Avoided environmental remediation

### Water Utility-Specific Benefits

- Avoided treatment plant/pump station damage
- Avoided service disruptions during disasters
- Avoided emergency water purchases
- Avoided emergency repair costs
- Avoided regulatory penalties

### Recent Discount Rate Changes

**Historical:** 7% discount rate (created barriers for long-term projects)

**August 2024:** Reduced to 3.1% discount rate
- Made more projects cost-effective
- Aligned with updated OMB Circular A-94

**April 8, 2025:** Reverted to 7% discount rate
- OMB revoked November 2023 Circular A-94 update
- Projects viable at 3.1% may fail at 7%
- Significant impact on disadvantaged communities

### Streamlined BCA Provisions

**Projects under $1 million:**
- Cost-effectiveness narrative acceptable
- No full BCA required
- Qualitative and quantitative data demonstrating benefits

**Technical Assistance:**
- FEMA offers BCA assistance to disadvantaged communities
- Cal OES Hazard Mitigation Technical Assistance Team available

### FEMA BCA Toolkit

- Excel-based calculation tool
- Estimates damages before/after mitigation
- Incorporates standard assumptions and default values
- Automatically applies current discount rate
