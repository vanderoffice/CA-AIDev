# State Regulatory Response to Climate Change and Water

## State Water Resources Control Board Climate Initiatives

### Climate Change Resolutions

**2007 Climate Change Resolution:**
- Initial actions to respond to climate change
- Supports implementation of California's Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32)
- Committed Water Boards to promote measures reducing greenhouse gas emissions
- Established framework for helping Californians adapt to climate impacts

**2017 Climate Change Resolution:**
- Directs proactive approach to embedding climate change in all Water Board actions
- Applies to programs, projects, and activities across all divisions
- Requires consideration of climate impacts in permit decisions
- Integrates climate resilience into water quality planning

**2021 Racial Equity Resolution:**
- Recognizes climate change disproportionately affects BIPOC communities
- Makes environmental justice integral to climate adaptation planning
- Requires equitable distribution of adaptation benefits
- Protects vulnerable communities in climate response

### Water Board Climate Programs

The Water Boards integrate climate considerations into:
- Water quality standards and basin plans
- Permitting decisions
- Enforcement priorities
- Water rights administration
- Groundwater management oversight

## Department of Water Resources Climate Action Plan

### Three-Phase Structure

**Phase I - Greenhouse Gas Reduction:**
- Commitment to carbon neutrality by 2035
- 100% zero-carbon electricity for DWR operations by 2035
- State Water Project is one of California's largest electricity consumers (~8,000 GWh/year)
- Updated in 2023 with refined targets and strategies

**Phase II - Planning Integration:**
- Framework for consistent climate change analysis
- Standards for scientific rigor across departmental activities
- Guidance for incorporating climate projections into project planning
- Alignment of climate analysis methods across programs

**Phase III - Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation:**
- Comprehensive assessment of DWR asset vulnerabilities
- Quantifies climate change impacts on infrastructure and operations
- Adaptation Plan prioritizes resilience efforts
- Includes infrastructure improvements, maintenance procedures, safety protocols, habitat management

### State Water Project Adaptation Strategy (2025)

Five key adaptation actions evaluated:
1. **Delta Conveyance Project** - Identified as single most effective strategy
2. **Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations (FIRO)** - Low cost, few drawbacks
3. **Additional South-of-Delta water storage**
4. **Continued infrastructure maintenance and restoration**
5. **Supplementary strategies** (recycling, conservation, etc.)

Key finding: Portfolio of actions can offset much of projected delivery decline

## Interagency Coordination

### California Climate Adaptation Strategy (2024)

Six key resilience priorities:
1. Strengthen protections for climate vulnerable communities
2. Bolster public health and safety against increasing climate risks
3. Build a climate resilient economy
4. Accelerate nature-based climate solutions
5. Make decisions based on best available climate science
6. Partner and collaborate to leverage resources

### Water Resilience Portfolio (2020, updated through 2023)

142 separate actions organized into four categories:
1. **Maintaining and diversifying water supplies** - Reduce reliance on any single source
2. **Protecting and enhancing natural ecosystems** - Restore river systems and environmental health
3. **Building connections** - Improve infrastructure to store, move, and share water
4. **Integrating water management** - Share science, data, and technology

### California Natural Resources Agency

- Coordinates climate adaptation across state agencies
- Leads California Climate Adaptation Strategy updates
- Oversees Water Resilience Portfolio implementation
- Integrates climate science into policy development

## Climate Resilience Programs

### Habitat Restoration

Since 2020, DWR and partners have completed:
- 16 separate restoration projects
- Approximately 7,000 acres enhanced within Delta region (~11 square miles)
- Native fish species using restored habitats within months of completion
- Additional 6 projects under construction or planning

### Groundwater Recharge Initiatives

**Flood-Managed Aquifer Recharge (Flood-MAR):**
- Diverts floodwaters to recharge groundwater
- Uses aquifer as underground reservoir
- Can achieve 40-60% reduction in groundwater overdraft when combined with FIRO

**Flood Diversion and Recharge Enhancement (FDRE) Initiative:**
- Provides temporary flood diversion equipment to local agencies
- Funding for clearing lands for recharge basins
- Executive Orders N-4-23 and N-7-23 allow flood flow diversion for recharge without water right
- SB 122 (2023) codified provisions through January 1, 2029

### Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations

- Uses advanced weather forecasting to inform reservoir operations
- More flexible decisions about water storage and release
- Simultaneously reduces flood risk and increases water supply
- Requires coordination with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

## Infrastructure Modernization

### Delta Conveyance Project

Proposed to address multiple vulnerabilities:
- Aging levees vulnerable to sea level rise, earthquakes, flooding
- Two new intakes on Sacramento River with advanced fish screens
- Single tunnel beneath Delta to existing pumping facilities
- Estimated cost: $20.1 billion (2023 dollars)
- Would capture water during large storm events for storage

### California Aqueduct Repairs

- Subsidence-damaged sections require repair
- Aging infrastructure deteriorating under climate stress
- Prioritized in State Water Project Adaptation Strategy

## Executive Actions

### Climate-Related Executive Orders

- N-4-23 and N-7-23: Flood flow diversion for recharge
- Emergency proclamations during drought events
- Direction for agency coordination on climate resilience
