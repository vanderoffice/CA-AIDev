# Climate Change Impacts on California Water Supply

## Snowpack as Natural Water Storage

### Historical Role of Snowpack

The Sierra Nevada snowpack has historically served as California's largest natural water reservoir:
- Provides approximately 15 million acre-feet annually
- Represents about one-third of California's total water supply
- At spring peak, contains approximately 70% as much water as all constructed reservoirs combined
- April 1 measurement date captures typical maximum depth before melt season

### Snowpack Decline Projections

Climate change is dramatically reducing this natural storage:
- **Mid-century**: Snowpack decline of more than one-third
- **End of century**: Snowpack decline of more than half
- Mechanism: Warmer temperatures cause more precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow
- Freezing level elevation has already risen approximately 500 feet

### Emerging Low-to-No Snow Conditions

- "Persistent low-to-no snow": More than half of a mountain basin experiencing low-to-no snow for 10 consecutive years
- Episodic conditions possible as early as late 2040s
- Persistent conditions potentially beginning in the 2060s

## Earlier Snowmelt Timing

### Runoff Shift

- Peak runoff potentially shifting more than a month earlier in some watersheds
- Spring runoff (April-July) has declined approximately 8% over the past century
- Historical peak runoff in late May/June now occurring earlier

### Management Implications

- Mismatch between water availability and peak demand
- Peak agricultural irrigation demand occurs in summer
- Earlier runoff requires greater reservoir storage capacity
- Reservoirs must capture water earlier, potentially conflicting with flood control operations

## Groundwater Implications

### Increased Reliance During Drought

- Average years: Groundwater provides approximately 40% of water supply
- Dry years: Groundwater provides up to 60% of water supply
- Climate change increases frequency of dry years, increasing groundwater dependence

### Recharge Reduction

- Less snowmelt runoff available for natural groundwater recharge
- Changed precipitation timing affects infiltration
- More intense storms create more runoff, less recharge

### Overdraft and Subsidence

- Cumulative deficits from decades of excess pumping
- San Joaquin Valley experiencing land subsidence of up to one foot per year in extreme cases
- Subsidence damages water conveyance infrastructure (canals, aqueducts)
- Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) addressing overdraft in 94 medium/high priority basins

## State Water Project Delivery Impacts

### Current Projections

The 2023 State Water Project Delivery Capability Report projects:
- Delivery capability could be reduced by up to 23% within 20 years
- Equivalent to approximately 496,000 acre-feet per year
- Enough water to supply 1,736,000 homes annually

### Causes of Reduced Reliability

1. More precipitation falling as rain rather than snow
2. Earlier runoff timing when reservoir flood storage is active
3. Reduced flexibility to store water without releasing for flood control
4. Regulatory requirements for environmental protection
5. Delta salinity increases constraining export operations

## Surface Water Availability

### Streamflow Changes

- Earlier peak flows create reservoir management challenges
- Reduced summer baseflows affect water availability when demand peaks
- Impaired cold water habitats for temperature-sensitive fish species
- Reduced flows impact hydroelectric generation

### Reservoir Operations

- Reservoirs fill earlier in the year
- Must release excess water that cannot be stored
- Limits overall storage capability for water supply
- Cold water pool in reservoirs reduced, affecting downstream habitat

## Extreme Event Impacts

### Drought

- More frequent and severe droughts projected
- Higher temperatures increase evaporative demand
- Compound effects: reduced precipitation, higher temperatures, earlier snowmelt
- Lessons from 2012-2016 and 2020-2022 droughts informing planning

### Flooding

- More intense precipitation events increase flood risk
- Lives lost to flooding projected to double (Sacramento Basin) and quadruple (San Joaquin Basin) over 50 years without investment
- Flood infrastructure designed for historical precipitation patterns
- Urban stormwater systems challenged by increased intensity
