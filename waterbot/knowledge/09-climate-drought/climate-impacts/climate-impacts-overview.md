# Climate Change Impacts on California Water - Overview

## Scientific Consensus

California's climate is undergoing measurable change with direct consequences for water resources. The California Fourth Climate Change Assessment represents the most comprehensive scientific evaluation of these impacts, providing projections under different emissions scenarios.

### Temperature Trends Already Observed

- Annual temperatures have increased more than 1°F across most of California
- Some areas have experienced increases exceeding 2°F
- Warming is already affecting snowpack, streamflow timing, and water demand

### Temperature Projections

**Mid-Century (2050):**
- Daily maximum temperatures projected to rise 4.4°F to 5.8°F compared to historical baselines
- Northern California summer temperatures: 3°F to 6.1°F increase
- Southern California summer temperatures: 2.3°F to 5.6°F increase

**End of Century (2100):**
- Daily maximum temperatures could rise 5.6°F to 8.8°F
- Inland areas will warm faster than coastal regions
- Summer temperatures will increase most rapidly

## Precipitation Pattern Changes

### Annual Totals

Total annual precipitation across California is not expected to change substantially on average - a counterintuitive but critical finding. However, the characteristics of precipitation will shift dramatically.

### Intensity and Variability

- Heavy precipitation events will become more frequent in Northern California
- Extreme precipitation could become twice as frequent
- 50-year precipitation events may occur twice as often by end of century
- More intense storms interspersed with longer dry periods

### "Weather Whiplash"

The increasing swing between extremely wet and extremely dry years creates planning challenges:
- Since 2011: Record lows in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2022
- Interspersed with record highs in 2011, 2017, 2019, 2023
- Infrastructure designed for historical patterns is stressed by new extremes

## Fourth Climate Change Assessment Key Findings

### Primary Conclusions

1. **Temperature certainty**: High confidence in warming projections across all models
2. **Precipitation uncertainty**: Greater variability in precipitation projections
3. **Snowpack decline**: Projected losses of one-third by mid-century, more than half by end of century
4. **Sea level rise**: 1.6 to 3.1 feet by 2100, with potential for 6.6 feet under extreme scenarios
5. **Extreme events**: Increased frequency and intensity of both floods and droughts

### Regional Findings

The Sierra Nevada region, producing approximately 26 million acre-feet of annual streamflow, faces:
- Snowpack losses already underway
- Changed snowmelt timing challenging water management
- Impacts to approximately 15% of California's in-state power generation (hydroelectric)

## Implications for Water Management

### Infrastructure Challenges

- Water systems designed for historical precipitation patterns
- Current infrastructure cannot fully capture intense storm events
- Flood control and water supply systems increasingly in conflict
- Aging infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather stress

### Planning Horizons

California's water management must adapt to:
- Earlier seasonal water availability
- Reduced natural storage (snowpack)
- Greater year-to-year variability
- More frequent extreme events requiring emergency response
