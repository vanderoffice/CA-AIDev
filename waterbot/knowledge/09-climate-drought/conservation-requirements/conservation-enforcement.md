# Water Conservation Enforcement and Reporting

## State Water Board Enforcement Authority

### Progressive Enforcement Framework

The Making Conservation a California Way of Life regulation establishes a graduated enforcement approach:

| Date | Enforcement Action |
|------|-------------------|
| November 1, 2023 | May issue informational orders |
| November 1, 2024 | May issue written notices |
| November 1, 2025 | May issue conservation orders |
| November 1, 2027 | May impose civil liability fines |

### Enforcement Step 1: Informational Orders

- Request additional information on water production, use, and conservation efforts
- Supplier must explain why not meeting objectives
- Detail specific actions being taken or planned
- Allows State Water Board to assess circumstances

### Enforcement Step 2: Written Notices

- Formal notification of non-compliance
- Issued to suppliers failing to respond adequately to informational orders
- Typically includes deadline for demonstrating progress

### Enforcement Step 3: Conservation Orders

- Formal regulatory orders
- Require implementation of specific measures:
  - Accelerated toilet replacement programs
  - Water-efficient appliance rebates
  - Landscape conversion programs
  - Rate increases
  - Other demand management actions

### Enforcement Step 4: Civil Liability Fines

Available beginning November 1, 2027 for suppliers not meeting objectives despite earlier enforcement actions.

## Penalty Structures

### Water Rights Violations (AB 460, 2024)

**Violations of permits, licenses, certificates, regulations, or orders:**
- Maximum: $1,000 per day (increased from $500)

**Curtailment order violations:**
- Maximum: $10,000 per day for each day of violation
- Plus: $2,500 per acre-foot of water diverted
- Begins on first day of violation

**Cease-and-desist order violations:**

During critically dry conditions or Governor-declared drought emergency:
- Maximum: $10,000 per day

All other violations:
- Maximum: $2,500 per day (increased from $1,000)

### Inflation Adjustment

Beginning January 1, 2026, State Water Board must adjust all penalties for inflation annually.

### Supplemental Environmental Projects

Alternative to or reduction of penalties in certain circumstances:
- Environmentally beneficial projects
- Must improve, protect, or reduce risks to public health or environment
- Must primarily benefit public health or environment (not violator)

## Reporting Requirements

### Annual Urban Water Use Objective Report

**Due:** January 1 of each year (beginning 2024)

**Submission:** WUEdata Portal

**Required Elements:**

1. **Residential Indoor Budget**
   - Volume (gallons/year)
   - Residential service area population
   - Indoor standard applied
   - Seasonal population adjustments (if applicable)

2. **Outdoor Residential Budget**
   - Landscape area measurement (from DWR or approved alternative)
   - Reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
   - Effective precipitation
   - Landscape efficiency factor applied

3. **CII Dedicated Irrigation Meter Budget**
   - Aggregate landscape area
   - Landscape efficiency factor applied

4. **Real Water Loss Budget**
   - Volume (gallons/year)
   - Service connections (for gpcd standards)
   - Distribution system miles (for gal/mile/day standards)

### Water Loss Audit Requirements

**Annual submission to DWR required**

### Water Loss Questionnaires

| Questionnaire | Initial Due | Update Due |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Data Quality | December 31, 2023 | One-time |
| Pressure Management | December 31, 2023 | July 1, 2026 |
| Asset Management | July 1, 2024 | July 1, 2027 |

### Leak Registry

- Beginning January 1, 2029
- Three-year compilation of breaks, repairs, estimated water losses
- Due every three years thereafter

### Water Shortage Assessment Reports

**Due:** June 1 annually (beginning 2022)
**Submitted to:** Department of Water Resources

Content:
- Supply reliability assessment (20-year planning horizon)
- Actions if supplies fall short at various shortage levels

### Urban Water Management Plans

**Due:** Every 5 years (next: July 1, 2026 for 2025 plans)
**Submitted to:** Department of Water Resources

Required elements:
- 20-year water source reliability assessment
- Climate change impact consideration
- Demand management measures
- Water shortage contingency plan
- Recycled water use plans

## Water Shortage Contingency Plans

### Required Components

- Actions at each shortage level (0-10% through >50%)
- Public communication protocols
- Annual supply/demand assessment procedures
- Customer compliance procedures

### Adoption Process

- Must be formally adopted through public process
- Can be updated between 5-year UWMP cycles

## Prohibited Water Uses During Shortages

Typical prohibitions (from emergency regulations):
- Landscape irrigation causing runoff to adjacent property
- Washing sidewalks, driveways, buildings (unless health/safety risk)
- Flooding gutters or streets
- Washing vehicles without positive shut-off nozzle
- Irrigating within 48 hours of ¼ inch or more rainfall
- Watering drought-sensitive vegetation during declared emergencies

## Local Water Shortage Emergency Authority

### Water Code Sections 350-356

Public water suppliers may declare water shortage emergency when:
- Ordinary demands cannot be satisfied without depleting supply
- Insufficient water would remain for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection

### Declaration Process

1. Public hearing required (7-day prior notice)
2. Consumers may present needs and protest
3. Adopt conservation regulations upon declaration
4. Set aside water for health, safety, essential uses
5. Allocate remaining supply per conservation requirements

### Enforcement Options

- Restrictions on new/additional service connections
- Progressive water use reduction requirements
- Tiered rate structures
- Specific use limitations
- Service discontinuation for willful violations

## State Agency Roles

### State Water Resources Control Board

- Adopts and enforces conservation regulations
- Issues compliance orders
- Receives annual reports
- Maintains WUEdata Portal

### Department of Water Resources

- Provides landscape area measurements
- Annual weather data
- Guidance documents
- Technical assistance
- Reviews Urban Water Management Plans
- Receives water shortage assessments
