# Water Conservation Standards

## Indoor Residential Water Use Standard

### Standard Timeline

| Effective Date | Standard (gpcd) |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Through January 1, 2025 | 55 |
| January 1, 2025 | 47 |
| January 1, 2030 | 42 |

*gpcd = gallons per capita per day*

### Budget Calculation

Annual Residential Indoor Water Use Budget (gal/yr) = 
Indoor Standard × Residential Service Area Population × 365 days

### Key Points

- Applies to single-family and multi-family housing
- Calculated on supplier-wide basis
- State does not enforce at individual parcel level
- Population figures from Health and Safety Code Section 116530 reporting

## Outdoor Residential Water Use Standard

### Landscape Efficiency Factor (LEF) Timeline

**Regular Residential Landscapes:**
| Effective Date | LEF |
|----------------|-----|
| Through June 30, 2035 | 0.80 |
| July 1, 2035 | 0.63 |
| July 1, 2040 | 0.55 |

**Special Landscape Areas** (recreational turf, food gardens, existing tree canopy):
| Effective Date | LEF |
|----------------|-----|
| Through June 30, 2035 | 1.0 |
| July 1, 2035 | 0.63 |
| July 1, 2040 | 0.55 |

### Budget Calculation Formula

Outdoor Residential Water Budget (gal/yr) = LAM × LEF × (ETo - Peff) × 0.62

Where:
- **LAM** = Landscape Area Measurement (sq ft)
- **LEF** = Landscape Efficiency Factor
- **ETo** = Reference evapotranspiration (provided annually by DWR)
- **Peff** = Effective precipitation (capped at 25% of total annual precipitation)
- **0.62** = Conversion factor to generate gallons per year

### Landscape Area Measurement Includes

Through June 30, 2027:
- Irrigable-irrigated areas
- Up to 20% of irrigable-not-irrigated areas
- Approved special landscape areas

## Commercial, Industrial, Institutional (CII) Standards

### Outdoor Irrigation with Dedicated Meters

- State does not enforce at individual parcel level
- Suppliers calculate aggregate CII dedicated irrigation meter landscape budget
- Supplier responsibility to map and quantify total landscape area
- Must be quantified by July 1, 2028

### Performance Measures (Not Budget-Based)

Three required performance measures for CII water use:

**1. Classification System**
- Develop water-centric classification for CII users
- Categories: food processing, beverage production, laundry services, hospitality, medical facilities, etc.
- Begin reporting progress by January 1, 2025
- Complete classification within 5 years of rule adoption

**2. Meter Conversion**
- Identify CII landscapes >1 acre with mixed-use meters
- Convert to dedicated irrigation meters within 5 years
- Alternative: Approved in-lieu technologies:
  - Water budget-based rate structures
  - Water budget-based management
  - Hardware improvements with enhanced performance
  - Remote sensing combined with data and hardware
  - Landscape plant palette transformation programs

**3. Best Management Practices**
- Target top 20% of CII users by water volume
- Priority focus on top 5% of individual accounts
- Five required BMP categories:
  1. Outreach, technical assistance, education
  2. Incentive programs
  3. Landscape improvements
  4. Collaboration with industry partners
  5. Operational improvements
- Must demonstrate increased water use efficiency
- Complete implementation within 3 years

### Process Water Exclusion

Process water (manufacturing/production) excluded from several CII requirements, but suppliers must still address top 20% of water-using sectors and top 2.5% of individual accounts.

## System Water Loss Standards

### Standard Development

- Calculated individually for each water system
- Based on economic feasibility analysis
- Considers infrastructure condition, baseline loss levels, cost-effectiveness of interventions
- Standards released December 8, 2025

### Standard Expression

Standards expressed as either:
- Gallons per connection per day (most systems), OR
- Gallons per mile of main per day (certain systems)

### Compliance Timeline

| Date | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| 2028 | Compliance deadline for most suppliers |
| 2031 | Extended deadline for disadvantaged communities (where benefit-to-cost <2 and reductions >25%) |

### Three-Year Rolling Average

- Compliance assessed on 3-year rolling average
- Allowed deviation: 5 gallons per connection per day

### Low-Loss Supplier "Off-Ramp"

Suppliers with average baseline real loss ≤16 gpcd (from 2017-2020) who meet data quality criteria may qualify for exemption from:
- Detailed questionnaires
- Annual break/repair registries
- Requirement to maintain loss below 16 gpcd

### California Context

- State average water loss: ~35 gallons per connection per day
- Total statewide annual losses: ~316,000 acre-feet

## Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance (MWELO)

### Applicability

Governs new development and retrofitted landscape projects.

### Local Agency Requirements

All local agencies must either:
- Adopt, implement, and enforce MWELO, OR
- Adopt locally equivalent ordinance at least as effective

### Key MWELO Elements

- Maximum applied water allowances
- Upper limits based on reference evapotranspiration
- ET adjustment factors
- Irrigated landscape area calculations
- Climate-adapted plant selection requirements
- Soil improvement requirements
- Irrigation system efficiency standards
- Irrigation scheduling requirements

### 2025 Update

Updated MWELO effective January 2, 2025.
