# California Water Conservation Framework

## Making Conservation a California Way of Life

### Overview

The "Making Conservation a California Way of Life" regulation represents California's shift from emergency-driven conservation to permanent, efficiency-based standards. Adopted by State Water Board July 3, 2024 (Resolution 2024-0019), effective January 1, 2025.

### Key Principles

- **Supplier-level objectives**: Standards apply to water suppliers, not individual households
- **Individualized targets**: Each supplier receives unique objectives based on service area characteristics
- **Local flexibility**: Suppliers choose how to achieve targets through locally appropriate solutions
- **Permanent framework**: Replaces cycle of emergency restrictions followed by relaxation

### Projected Impact

- Reduce urban water use by over 400,000 acre-feet annually by 2030
- Applies to urban retail water suppliers serving ~95% of Californians

### Tools Available to Suppliers

Suppliers may use diverse methods to achieve objectives:
- Education and outreach programs
- Leak detection and repair initiatives
- Rate reform and pricing mechanisms
- Incentives for climate-ready landscapes
- Rebates for efficient fixtures and appliances
- Best management practices for large commercial users

## SB 606 and AB 1668 (2018)

### Legislative Foundation

Two companion bills (Hertzberg/Friedman) established California's long-term water use efficiency framework, building on Governor Brown's efforts to make conservation permanent.

### Key Requirements Established

1. Efficiency standards on supplier-wide basis (not individual customer)
2. Comprehensive framework for implementation and oversight
3. Direction for DWR and State Water Board to develop standards
4. Progressive enforcement timeline
5. Reporting and compliance mechanisms

### Studies and Investigations Required

The legislation directed DWR/State Water Board to study:
- Indoor residential water use standards and impacts
- Outdoor residential water use standards
- CII outdoor irrigation with dedicated meters
- Appropriate variances for unique water uses
- Guidelines for calculating urban water use objectives
- Performance measures for CII water uses

## Implementation Timeline

### Major Deadlines

| Date | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| July 1, 2021 | Suppliers update/adopt Urban Water Management Plans |
| June 1, 2022 | Begin annual water shortage assessment reports |
| June 30, 2022 | State Board adopt standards (deadline met) |
| November 1, 2023 | State Board may issue informational orders |
| January 1, 2024 | Begin annual urban water use objective reporting |
| November 1, 2024 | State Board may issue written notices |
| January 1, 2025 | Regulation becomes effective |
| November 1, 2025 | State Board may issue conservation orders |
| November 1, 2027 | State Board may impose civil liability fines |
| January 1, 2030 | Indoor standard decreases to 42 gpcd |

## Urban Water Use Objective Components

### Four Budget Categories

The urban water use objective combines four standard-based efficiency budgets:

1. **Residential Indoor Water Use**
   - Based on gallons per capita per day
   - Multiplied by population and 365 days

2. **Residential Outdoor Water Use**
   - Landscape efficiency factor methodology
   - Based on irrigated area and evapotranspiration

3. **CII Outdoor Irrigation (Dedicated Meters)**
   - Aggregate landscaped area with dedicated meters
   - Supplier responsibility to map and quantify

4. **Real Water Loss**
   - System-by-system calculation
   - Based on economic feasibility analysis

### Adjustments to Objective

- **Variances**: For unique water uses (agricultural landscapes, evaporative coolers, ornamental ponds, horse corrals)
- **Bonus Incentives**: For potable recycled water delivery
  - Existing potable reuse: up to 15% bonus
  - New potable reuse: up to 10% bonus

## Scope and Applicability

### Urban Retail Water Suppliers

Definition: Entities that either:
- Provide over 3,000 acre-feet of water annually, OR
- Serve more than 3,000 urban connections AND operate public water systems for urban purposes

### Compliance Flexibility

- Suppliers must meet overall objective, not individual components
- Exceeding one budget can be offset by savings in another
- Multiple pathways available for achieving objectives
- Local circumstances recognized in target-setting

## Role of State Agencies

### State Water Resources Control Board

- Adopted regulation (2024)
- Enforcement authority
- Receives annual reports
- Issues compliance orders

### Department of Water Resources

- Provides landscape area measurements
- Annual weather data (ETo, precipitation)
- Guidance documents
- Technical assistance
