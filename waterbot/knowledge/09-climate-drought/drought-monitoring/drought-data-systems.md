## California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring (CASGEM)

### Overview

Established by Legislature through SB X7-6 (2009) to collect groundwater level information statewide through collaboration between local monitoring parties and DWR.

### Historical Significance

First effort to make groundwater data publicly available on a statewide basis.

### Measurement Schedule

Most monitoring wells measured twice yearly:
- Spring measurement
- Fall measurement

## California's Groundwater Live

### Features

- Latest groundwater information
- Live statistics and interactive dashboards
- Organized by:
  - Current conditions
  - Groundwater levels
  - Well infrastructure
  - Land subsidence monitoring

### Real-Time Visibility

Provides visibility into groundwater—an essential supply component during drought periods.

## Water Data Library

### Overview

Administered by DWR, contains hydrologic data for over 35,000 wells in California.

### Data Types

- Groundwater level measurements
- Some groundwater quality information

### Data Sources

- DWR regional offices
- Dozens of local and federal cooperators

## SGMA Data Viewer

### Purpose

Provides access to groundwater-related datasets organized according to:
- Sustainable Groundwater Management Act requirements
- Groundwater Sustainability Plan regulations

### Uses

- Support GSP development
- Monitor GSP implementation
- Track basin sustainability indicators

## Natural Communities Commonly Associated with Groundwater (NCCAG) Dataset Viewer

### Purpose

Compiles publicly available state and federal agency datasets mapping:
- Vegetation dependent on groundwater
- Wetlands
- Springs
- Seeps

### Uses

- Assess ecological health
- Evaluate water availability for natural systems
- Support SGMA environmental considerations

## Sacramento Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model

### Technical Basis

- Based on Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM) code
- Uses C2VSim-Fine Grid dataset

### Applications

- Detailed analysis of streamflow depletion from groundwater pumping
- Support for groundwater substitution transfer analysis
- SGMA implementation support

## SGMA Water Year Type Dataset

### Overview

Available through California Natural Resources Agency Open Data Platform.

### Coverage

- 98 HUC-8 watersheds
- Water years 1931-2018
- Water year type classifications

### Uses

- Long-term trend analysis
- Historical watershed condition comparison
- SGMA planning support

## National Monitoring Integration

### U.S. Drought Monitor

- Weekly updates (Thursdays)
- D0-D4 classification system
- California-specific analysis
- Regional author input

**Access:** droughtmonitor.unl.edu

### NOAA National Integrated Drought Information System

- Federal drought monitoring coordination
- Data integration across agencies
- Drought.gov public portal

## Snow Survey Program

### Manual Snow Surveys

- Conducted since early 1900s
- Multiple survey courses throughout Sierra Nevada
- April 1 survey: Benchmark for peak snowpack

### Automated Stations

- Snow pillow sensors for continuous monitoring
- Telemetered data to CDEC
- Real-time snow water equivalent readings

## Reservoir Monitoring

### Key Reservoirs Tracked

Major state and federal reservoirs including:
- Lake Shasta (federal)
- Lake Oroville (state)
- Folsom Lake (federal)
- San Luis Reservoir (state/federal)
- Many others statewide

### Data Points

- Current storage volume
- Percent of capacity
- Comparison to historical average
- Inflow and outflow rates

## Data Integration for Drought Assessment

### Multi-Indicator Approach

Effective drought assessment requires integrating:
1. Precipitation (input)
2. Snowpack (natural storage)
3. Reservoir storage (managed storage)
4. Groundwater levels (underground storage)
5. Streamflow (availability)
6. Temperature (demand modifier)
7. Vegetation stress (impact indicator)

### Temporal Considerations

- Short-term indicators (1-3 months): Agriculture impacts
- Long-term indicators (6-60 months): Hydrological system impacts
- Real-time data: Emergency response
- Historical comparison: Context for current conditions
