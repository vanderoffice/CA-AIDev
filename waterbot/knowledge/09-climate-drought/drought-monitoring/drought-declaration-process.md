# Drought Declaration Processes in California

## Governor's Drought Proclamation Authority

### Legal Basis

The California Emergency Services Act (Government Code Section 8558) establishes three emergency conditions:
1. State of war emergency
2. State of emergency
3. Local emergency

Drought explicitly falls within conditions triggering these declarations.

### Proclamation Authority

Under Government Code Section 8625, the Governor may proclaim a state of emergency when:
- Conditions exist in any area affected by drought
- Local authority is inadequate to cope with emergency conditions
- Conditions by their magnitude are beyond the control of any single local government

### Emergency Powers Triggered

Government Code Section 8627 grants the Governor broad powers upon proclamation:
- Direct all state agencies to utilize personnel, equipment, and facilities
- Waive compliance with regulatory statutes hindering emergency response
- Issue orders and regulations as necessary to meet the emergency
- Suspend specified environmental review requirements
- Expedite water transfers and temporary water rights

### Typical Proclamation Directives

Governor drought proclamations typically:
- Direct state agencies to evaluate groundwater levels and land subsidence
- Require public updates on areas with shortages
- Direct DWR and State Water Board to coordinate with counties
- Call for voluntary water conservation (e.g., 15% reduction target)
- Accelerate funding for water supply enhancement projects
- Suspend specified regulatory requirements (with documentation)

### Notable Regulatory Suspensions

Proclamations have suspended:
- Water Code Section 1726: Written notice and newspaper publication requirements
- 30-day comment periods reduced to 15 days for water transfers
- CEQA requirements for specific emergency actions
- Water Code Section 13247 for place-of-use consolidations

## State Water Board Emergency Authority

### Water Code Section 1058.5

Grants State Water Board authority to adopt emergency regulations when findings are satisfied.

### Required Findings

The Board may adopt emergency regulations only when finding:
1. Regulation is adopted for one or more enumerated purposes (conservation, preventing waste, curtailment based on priority)
2. Regulation responds to critically dry year preceded by 2+ consecutive below-normal/dry/critically dry years, OR Governor has issued drought emergency proclamation

### Authorized Actions Under 1058.5

- Prevent waste and unreasonable use of water
- Promote water recycling and conservation
- Require curtailment of diversions based on priority
- Require reporting and monitoring

### Procedural Advantages

- Findings not subject to Office of Administrative Law review
- Regulations may remain in effect up to one year
- Deemed repealed upon Board finding conditions have changed
- May be renewed if drought conditions persist

### Water Rights Curtailment

Based on prior appropriation doctrine ("first in time, first in right"):
- Junior right holders face curtailment first
- Senior right holders may continue diversions
- Board evaluates water availability using hydrologic data
- Curtailment orders issued in priority order

**Violation Penalties:**
- Administrative civil liability up to $1,000/day
- Plus $2,500 per acre-foot illegally diverted
- Referral to Attorney General possible

## Local Drought Declarations

### Local Emergency Authority

Under California Emergency Services Act, local governments may declare emergencies when:
- Conditions of disaster or extreme peril exist
- Conditions are beyond control of local services/facilities

### Declaration Requirements

- Must be issued by governing body (city council, board of supervisors) or designated official
- If issued by designated official: must be ratified by governing body within 7 days
- Must notify operational area, which notifies Cal OES
- Provide signed copy of proclamation
- Should be issued within 10 days of incident occurrence

### Renewal and Termination

- Must renew at least every 60 days (Government Code Section 8630(c))
- Terminate at earliest date conditions warrant
- Emergency powers only for duration necessary

### Purposes of Local Declaration

- Provide extraordinary police powers
- Grant immunity for emergency actions
- Authorize emergency orders and regulations
- Activate pre-established emergency provisions
- Prerequisite for requesting state/federal assistance

### Water Shortage Emergency (Water Code 350-356)

Public water suppliers may declare water shortage emergency when:
- Ordinary demands cannot be satisfied without depleting supply
- Insufficient water would remain for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection

**Process:**
1. Public hearing required (notice published 7 days prior)
2. Consumers may present needs and protest
3. Upon declaration, adopt conservation regulations
4. Set aside water for health, safety, essential uses
5. Allocate remaining supply per conservation requirements

## Federal Drought Declarations

### USDA Disaster Designations

Secretary of Agriculture may designate counties as disaster areas:
- Enables emergency loans to agricultural producers
- Covers losses in designated and contiguous counties
- Triggers eligibility for FSA disaster assistance programs

**Drought Eligibility Criteria:**
- D2 (severe drought) for 8 consecutive weeks, or
- D3 (extreme drought) or greater intensity

### Presidential Disaster Declarations

Under the Stafford Act, two declaration types:

**Emergency Declaration:**
- Less severe designation
- Provides "essential" assistance (debris removal, temporary housing, emergency supplies)
- Governor must request within 5 days of need becoming apparent

**Major Disaster Declaration:**
- More comprehensive
- Authorizes public assistance, individual assistance, hazard mitigation programs
- Governor must request within 30 days of incident

### Request Requirements

Governor must provide:
- State certification that response exceeds state capability
- Confirmation of state emergency plan execution
- Description of state/local response efforts
- Identification of specific federal assistance needed

## Interagency Coordination

### Drought Emergency Coordination

- Governor's Drought Action Team (created during major droughts)
- State Water Board Regional Drought Response
- Cal OES coordination with local operational areas
- FEMA and USDA federal coordination

### Critical Watersheds for Special Monitoring

During 2022 drought, State Water Board focused on:
- Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
- Russian River
- Scott River
- Shasta River
- Mill Creek
- Deer Creek
