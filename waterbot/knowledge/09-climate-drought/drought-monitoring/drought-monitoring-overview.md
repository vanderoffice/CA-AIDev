# Drought Monitoring in California - Overview

## U.S. Drought Monitor Classification System

The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) provides the national standard for drought classification, updated weekly on Thursdays. It uses a five-category system managed by the National Drought Mitigation Center, NOAA, and USDA.

### Drought Classification Levels

| Category | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| D0 | Abnormally Dry | Precursor to drought, not actual drought |
| D1 | Moderate Drought | Some damage to crops, pastures; water shortages developing |
| D2 | Severe Drought | Crop/pasture losses likely; water shortages common |
| D3 | Extreme Drought | Major crop/pasture losses; widespread water shortages |
| D4 | Exceptional Drought | Exceptional and widespread crop/pasture losses; emergency water shortages |

### Classification Methodology

The USDM uses a "convergence of evidence" approach combining:
- Objective physical indicators (precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, streamflow)
- Subjective expert judgment from regional specialists
- Short-term measures (1-3 months) for agriculture impacts
- Long-term measures (6-60 months) for hydrological impacts

### Drought Severity and Coverage Index

The DSCI is an experimental metric that converts categorical USDM data into a continuous variable, enabling more nuanced analysis of drought patterns across geographic areas.

## Key Drought Indicators Tracked

### Precipitation

- Fundamental input to California's water system
- Tracked as percentage of historical averages
- California's precipitation exhibits tremendous year-to-year variability
- Total precipitation alone is insufficient without storage context

### Snowpack

- Sierra Nevada snowpack provides ~30% of California's water supply
- Snow water equivalent (SWE) measured at multiple locations statewide
- April 1st: Traditional peak snowpack measurement date
- Climate warming causing "snow droughts" even with adequate precipitation
- 2025: Snowpack disappeared 1-4 weeks earlier than normal in some basins

### Reservoir Storage

- California's primary drought buffer
- Compared to historical averages for same date
- Major reservoirs: Lake Shasta, Lake Oroville, Lake Powell
- Multi-year droughts can deplete storage to critical levels

### Groundwater

- Second major drought buffer
- California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring (CASGEM) tracks levels
- Most wells measured only twice yearly (spring and fall)
- Extraction increases during drought, causing level decline

### Streamflow

- Real-time water availability indicator
- Reflects natural runoff plus reservoir releases
- Tracked against historical ranges for each date
- Declining flows affect downstream users and ecosystems

### Soil Moisture

- Critical for agriculture and ecosystems
- Satellite-based observations at 100cm depth
- Depleted moisture increases crop water stress

### Temperature

- Higher temperatures increase evaporative demand
- Creates "thirstier" atmosphere
- Climate warming intensifying recent droughts

### Vegetation Stress

- Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) tracks plant water stress
- Satellite-based measurements
- Real-time indicator of drought ecosystem impacts

## Historical California Droughts

### Major Drought Events

| Period | Duration | Notable Characteristics |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| 1929-1934 | 5+ years | Among largest 10-year droughts in paleoclimate record |
| 1976-1977 | 2 years | Single driest year (1977) in recorded statewide runoff |
| 1987-1992 | 6 years | First extended drought since 1930s; reservoir storage fell to 40% of average |
| 2007-2009 | 3 years | First statewide emergency proclamation for drought |
| 2012-2016 | 5 years | Hottest drought on record; driest 3-year period (2012-14) |
| 2020-2022 | 3 years | Multi-year drought with significant curtailments |

### Paleoclimate Context

Tree-ring and archaeological evidence reveals:
- Drought is an inherent feature of California's climate
- Multiple extended dry periods over 1,000+ years
- Current water infrastructure developed under conditions not representing full climate variability
- More severe droughts than modern experience have occurred historically
