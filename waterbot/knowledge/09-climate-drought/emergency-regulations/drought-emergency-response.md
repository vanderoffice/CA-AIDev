# Drought Emergency Response

## Mandatory Conservation Measures

### Prohibited Water Uses (2021-2022 Emergency Regulations)

1. **Decorative fountains** - Without recirculation systems
2. **Post-rainfall irrigation** - During or within 48 hours of measurable precipitation (¼ inch or more)
3. **Hosing hard surfaces** - Sidewalks, driveways, patios (unless health/safety risk)
4. **Overwatering** - Causing runoff onto adjacent property or streets
5. **Vehicle washing** - Without positive shut-off nozzle
6. **Non-functional turf** - Irrigation with potable water at CII properties (2022)

### Level 2 Demand Reduction Actions

Required from urban water suppliers (May 2022):
- Mandatory landscape irrigation restrictions (specified days per week)
- Prohibited irrigation hours (typically 10 AM - 6 PM in summer)
- Increased enforcement of water waste prohibitions
- Target: ~20% supply shortage response

## Water Supplier Shortage Contingency Plans

### Required Shortage Response Levels

| Level | Shortage | Typical Actions |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0-10% | Voluntary conservation, public outreach |
| 2 | 10-20% | Mandatory irrigation restrictions, specific day limits |
| 3 | 20-30% | Reduced irrigation days, surcharges for excess use |
| 4 | 30-40% | Severe restrictions, prohibitions on new connections |
| 5 | 40-50% | Rationing by allocation, severe penalties |
| 6 | >50% | Emergency rationing, critical uses only |

### Plan Requirements

- Locally appropriate demand reduction actions for each level
- Supply augmentation actions (drought reserves, increased groundwater, recycling)
- Public communication protocols
- Annual supply/demand assessment procedures
- Customer compliance procedures

### Declaration Process

1. Governing board adopts resolution declaring shortage level
2. Mandatory conservation measures become effective (typically 10 days after publication)
3. Annual reporting to state by July 1

## SB 552 Small Water Supplier Requirements

### Applicability

Small water suppliers: <3,000 connections AND <3,000 acre-feet annually

### New Requirements (2021)

- Abridged water shortage contingency plans (due July 1, 2023)
- Annual water supply condition and use reporting (by month)
- Infrastructure upgrades to drought-resilient standards if needed
- Plans posted on website and available to State Water Board

### County Drought Task Forces

- Each county must establish drought resilience task force
- Address unique vulnerabilities of small systems and domestic wells
- Coordinate state technical and financial assistance

## Lessons from 2012-2016 Drought

### Drinking Water Emergency

- First widespread drinking water emergency affecting thousands of households
- Mostly disadvantaged communities in southern San Joaquin Valley
- Heavy agricultural groundwater pumping depleted aquifers, stranded domestic wells
- $115 million emergency response funding allocated

### State Response

- ~$500,000 monthly in bulk/bottled water to affected communities
- 2+ million boxes of food to community food banks
- 180+ small water systems assisted with infrastructure improvements
- Emergency connections to larger, more reliable suppliers

### Key Policy Outcomes

**Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) - 2014:**
- First statewide groundwater monitoring requirement
- Groundwater Sustainability Agencies for medium/high priority basins
- Groundwater Sustainability Plans required
- Sustainability by 2040 (with interim targets)

**Improved Data Systems:**
- Exposed lack of coherent statewide water accounting
- Investment in real-time monitoring capabilities
- Enhanced coordination between agencies

## Lessons from 2020-2022 Drought

### More Aggressive Regulatory Response

- Multiple emergency regulations in rapid succession
- Expanded curtailment orders to unprecedented breadth
- April 2022: Early warning letters to ~20,000 water rights holders
- June 2022: 4,000+ water rights curtailed in Delta watershed

### Enhanced Capabilities

- InSAR satellite technology for groundwater/subsidence monitoring
- Pre-positioned emergency drinking water supplies
- More proactive management of vulnerable communities
- Better coordination with fish/wildlife agencies for instream flows

### Non-Functional Turf Ban

- Targeted ~2 million acres of commercial decorative turfgrass
- First broad prohibition on specific landscape type
- Later converted to permanent statute (AB 1572)

## Agricultural Adaptation

### 2012-2016 Drought Agricultural Response

With ~30% surface water reduction:
- **~2/3 of shortage**: Replaced through additional groundwater pumping
- **~10% of shortage**: Fallowing ~500,000 acres (~6% of irrigated agriculture)
- **Remainder**: Stress irrigation and crop shifting

### Consequences

- Groundwater overdraft ~2.5 million acre-feet annually during drought
- Record land subsidence in Central Valley (up to 1 foot/year in places)
- $600 million annually in additional pumping costs
- Demonstrated unsustainability of using overdraft as drought buffer

## Emergency Coordination

### State Agency Coordination

- Governor's Drought Task Force
- State Water Board Regional Drought Response
- DWR technical support and monitoring
- Fish and Wildlife coordination for environmental flows
- Cal OES emergency response

### Pre-Positioning

- Emergency water supplies in vulnerable areas
- Technical assistance to small systems
- Funding for emergency infrastructure
- Communication protocols for rapid response

## Humanitarian Protections

### Essential Uses Protected

Emergency regulations always exempt:
- Drinking water
- Sanitation
- Personal hygiene
- Food preparation
- Fire suppression
- Medical needs

### Vulnerable Population Focus

- Disadvantaged communities prioritized for assistance
- Small water systems receive enhanced support
- Domestic well owners eligible for emergency programs
