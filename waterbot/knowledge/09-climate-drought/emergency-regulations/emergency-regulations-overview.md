# Emergency Drought Regulations - Overview

## State Water Board Emergency Rulemaking Authority

### Water Code Section 1058.5

**Finding 2 - Conditions:**
Regulation must respond to EITHER:
- Critically dry year immediately preceded by 2+ consecutive below-normal, dry, or critically dry years, OR
- Governor-proclaimed state of emergency under California Emergency Services Act based on drought

### Regulatory Provisions

**Duration:**
- May remain in effect up to one year
- Deemed repealed upon Board finding conditions no longer necessary

- May suspend CEQA for specific drought response actions

### Coordination

- Emergency proclamation sets policy direction
- State Water Board implements through emergency regulations
- Regional Water Boards coordinate local enforcement
- DWR provides technical support and data

## Exemptions and Accommodations

### Standard Exemptions

Emergency regulations typically exempt:
- Health and safety needs (drinking, sanitation, hygiene, food prep, fire suppression)
- Essential agricultural operations
- Animal watering
- Non-potable water irrigation

### HOA Protections

Davis-Stirling Act provisions:
