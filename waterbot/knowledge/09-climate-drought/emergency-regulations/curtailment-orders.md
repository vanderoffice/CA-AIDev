# Water Rights Curtailment Orders

## Curtailment Authority

### Legal Basis

State Water Board may issue curtailment orders when evaluation shows insufficient water to support all known needs in a watershed. Constitutional finding: Continuing diversions that would cause flows to fall below drought emergency minimums constitutes unreasonable use under Article X, Section 2.

### Evaluation Factors

Board staff evaluate water availability using:
- Current and forecasted hydrologic information
- Water use data from water right holders
- Environmental water needs
- Projected supplies
- Other relevant factors

## Priority System During Curtailments

### Water Rights Hierarchy

**Most Senior (Last to be Curtailed):**
1. Riparian rights (priority date = land patent date, generally equal among themselves)
2. Pre-1914 appropriative rights (demonstrated through beneficial use before 1914)

**Most Junior (First to be Curtailed):**
3. Post-1914 appropriative rights (ordered by permit application date, most recent first)

### "First in Time, First in Right"

The prior appropriation doctrine (established 1855) means:
- First to apply water to beneficial use acquires vested right
- Junior rights holders bear first burden during shortages
- Curtailment proceeds from most recent to oldest priority dates
- Senior rights holders protected until all junior rights curtailed

## Curtailment Order Process

### Issuance

- Orders issued by Deputy Director or designees
- Effective day after issuance (unless otherwise specified)
- Establish threshold below which flows must be maintained
- Specify which water rights/claims are curtailed

### Order Content

Orders identify:
- Specific water rights affected (by ID number)
- Geographic scope (watersheds, tributaries)
- Priority date cutoffs
- Exempted categories
- Reporting requirements

### Example: June 2022 Delta Watershed Order

- Affected 4,000+ water rights and claims
- Multiple tributaries with different priority cutoffs
- Priority dates ranging from 1850 (Putah Creek) to 1957 (Stony Creek)
- First broad curtailment of riparian rights in certain tributaries

## Exceptions to Curtailment

### Minimum Human Health and Safety

- Domestic water use (drinking, cooking, bathing, sanitation)
- Firefighting needs
- Requires certification form submission
- Must be only available water source
- Quantified per-person per-day basis

### Non-Consumptive Uses

- Run-of-river hydroelectric generation
- Uses where water returned in same quantity/quality
- No net depletion of streamflow

### Minimum Livestock Watering

- Essential livestock water needs
- Must be only available source
- Requires demonstration/certification

### Local Cooperative Solutions

Agricultural users may propose alternatives:
- Best management practices
- Graduated cessation schedules (phased reduction)
- Collaborative arrangements
- Must provide reasonable assurance flows will be maintained
- Executive Director discretion to approve

## Curtailment Enforcement

### Penalties (Current - AB 460, 2024)

**Daily Penalty:**
- Up to $10,000 per day (increased from $1,000)

**Per Acre-Foot Surcharge:**
- $2,500 per acre-foot diverted in violation
- Begins on first day of violation

**Combined Impact Example:**
5 acre-feet daily illegal diversion = $10,000 + $12,500 = $22,500/day

### Administrative Process

1. Investigation and inspection by Board staff
2. Cease and desist order for immediate termination
3. Administrative civil liability proceedings
4. Potential referral to Attorney General for court enforcement

### Petitions for Reconsideration

- Must submit within 30 days of order issuance
- Follow Water Code sections 1122-1124 procedures
- Filing does NOT automatically stay curtailment
- Must comply while petition pending unless Board orders stay

## Information Orders

Board may compel water users to provide:
- Diversion volume reports
- Use patterns
- Alternative water supplies accessed
- Conservation measures implemented
- Compliance efforts

Failure to respond within timeframe (typically 7+ days) = separate violation.

## Curtailed Watersheds (2022)

Critical watersheds with curtailment orders:
- Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
- Russian River
- Scott River
- Shasta River
- Mill Creek
- Deer Creek

### Monitoring Responsibilities

Water right holders must:
- Monitor curtailment status on Regional Drought Response websites
- Cease diversions immediately upon curtailment notification
- Submit required reports
- Qualify for exceptions if claiming exemption

## Environmental Integration

### Fishery Protection

Minimum instream flows specified for:
- Central Valley spring-run salmon
- Central Valley steelhead
- Other threatened/endangered species

### Adaptive Management

Deputy Director may suspend curtailments when:
- DFW or NMFS confirms fish not present
- Field surveys indicate reduced flow needs
- Conditions differ from assumptions in targets

### Health vs. Environment Priority

Executive Director has discretion when:
- Maintaining fishery flows would curtail essential human health diversions
- Human health and safety receives highest priority
- Fishery flows may be reduced to accommodate essential human needs
