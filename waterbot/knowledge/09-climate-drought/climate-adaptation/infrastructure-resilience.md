# Water Infrastructure Resilience

## Aging Infrastructure Challenge

California faces significant challenges from aging water infrastructure requiring modernization to meet climate adaptation needs.

### Current Conditions
- Many water systems date to early-mid 20th century
- Deferred maintenance across the state
- Increasing failure rates and water loss
- Design standards outdated for current conditions

### Climate Stressors on Infrastructure
- Extreme heat degrading materials
- Flooding overwhelming conveyance capacity
- Drought intensifying corrosion and settling
- Wildfire damaging distribution systems
- Sea level rise threatening coastal facilities

## Delta Conveyance and Resilience

### Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
The Delta is the hub of California's water system, conveying water to 27 million people and 3 million acres of farmland.

### Climate Vulnerabilities
- **Sea level rise**: Increasing saltwater intrusion
- **Levee failure risk**: Aging earthen levees vulnerable to earthquakes and flooding
- **Ecosystem stress**: Warming temperatures affecting native species
- **Water quality**: Changing conditions affecting treatment requirements

### Delta Conveyance Project
Proposed infrastructure to improve reliability:
- Single tunnel design (capacity approximately 6,000 cubic feet per second)
- Reduces reliance on through-Delta conveyance
- Maintains water supply during levee failures or earthquakes
- Environmental review ongoing

### Multi-Benefit Approach
Beyond conveyance, Delta resilience includes:
- Levee improvement programs
- Ecosystem restoration (EcoRestore)
- Flood risk reduction
- Subsidence reversal projects

## Flood Management Infrastructure

### Challenges
- Flood events intensifying with climate change
- Existing levees and channels designed for historical conditions
- Urban development in floodplains
- Aging flood control infrastructure

### Adaptation Strategies

#### Levee Improvements
- Urban levee upgrades to 200-year protection
- Rural levee rehabilitation
- Multi-benefit levee projects incorporating habitat
- Central Valley Flood Protection Plan implementation

#### Bypasses and Floodways
- Yolo Bypass expansion studies
- Lower San Joaquin River bypass improvements
- Transitory storage in floodplains
- Forecast-based operations

#### Green Infrastructure
- Setback levees creating river room
- Floodplain restoration
- Wetland enhancement for flood attenuation
- Watershed management reducing peak flows

## Wildfire Impacts on Water Systems

### Direct Impacts
- Damage to pipelines, tanks, and treatment facilities
- Contamination of distribution systems
- Loss of source water quality
- Power outages affecting pumping

### Watershed Impacts
- Post-fire erosion and sedimentation
- Debris flows threatening infrastructure
- Altered runoff patterns
- Long-term water quality degradation

### Resilience Strategies
- Hardening water infrastructure in fire-prone areas
- Backup power systems
- Emergency interconnections
- Watershed management and forest health
- Post-fire response protocols
- Source water protection investments

## Coastal Infrastructure

### Sea Level Rise Threats
- Treatment plant inundation
- Saltwater intrusion into groundwater
- Erosion threatening pipelines
- Flooding of pump stations

### Adaptation Approaches
- Relocating vulnerable facilities
- Elevating critical infrastructure
- Saltwater intrusion barriers
- Enhanced monitoring and early warning
- Living shorelines and natural buffers

## Dam Safety and Modernization

### Safety Improvements
- Spillway upgrades (post-Oroville Dam incident)
- Seismic retrofitting
- Updated hydrologic analyses
- Enhanced monitoring systems

### Operational Modernization
- Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations (FIRO)
- Real-time monitoring technology
- Adaptive operating rules
- Climate scenario planning

### Key Projects
- Oroville Dam spillway reconstruction
- Lake Mendocino FIRO implementation
- Statewide dam safety inspections
- Emergency action plan updates

## Treatment Plant Resilience

### Climate Adaptation

- Research and technology adoption

## Distribution System Modernization

### Leak Reduction
- Advanced leak detection technology
- Pipe replacement programs
- Pressure management
- Water loss auditing and reporting

### Smart Water Systems
- Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)
- Real-time monitoring and control
- Predictive maintenance
- Customer engagement platforms

## Funding and Investment

### State Funding Programs
- **Proposition 4 (2024)**: $10 billion climate bond with significant water infrastructure components
- **State Revolving Fund**: Low-interest loans for water infrastructure
- **Integrated Regional Water Management grants**: Competitive funding for regional projects
- **Dam Safety Program**: State matching funds for safety improvements
