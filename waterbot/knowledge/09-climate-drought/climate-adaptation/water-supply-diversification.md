# Water Supply Diversification Strategies

## Overview

Water supply diversification is a cornerstone of California's climate adaptation strategy. By developing multiple water sources, communities reduce vulnerability to climate-driven supply disruptions and improve overall water security.

## Recycled Water

### Current Status
California recycles approximately 728,000 acre-feet annually, with significant expansion potential.

### Types of Recycled Water Use
- **Non-potable reuse**: Landscape irrigation, industrial processes, agricultural irrigation
- **Indirect potable reuse (IPR)**: Groundwater replenishment, reservoir augmentation
- **Direct potable reuse (DPR)**: Emerging regulations for purified water directly entering distribution systems

### Regulatory Framework
- Title 22 recycled water regulations
- Division of Drinking Water oversight for potable reuse
- Regional Water Board permitting
- SB 918 and AB 574 advancing direct potable reuse

### Major Projects
- Orange County Groundwater Replenishment System (world's largest)
- Los Angeles Pure Water Program
- San Diego Pure Water Program
- Silicon Valley Advanced Water Purification Center

### Expansion Goals
The state targets 800,000 acre-feet of new recycled water by 2030, with continued growth through:
- Advanced treatment technology
- Streamlined permitting
- Public education and acceptance
- Infrastructure investment

## Desalination

### Seawater Desalination
- **Carlsbad Desalination Plant**: 50 million gallons per day, largest in Western Hemisphere
- High reliability but energy-intensive
- Environmental considerations for intake and brine discharge
- Permitting through California Coastal Commission and Regional Boards

### Brackish Water Desalination
- Lower energy requirements than seawater
- Treats groundwater with elevated salinity
- Multiple facilities operating in Southern California
- Growing role in contaminated groundwater remediation

### Challenges and Considerations
- Energy consumption and carbon footprint
- Marine life impacts from intake structures
- Brine disposal and ocean impacts
- High capital and operating costs
- Coastal development restrictions

## Stormwater Capture and Reuse

### Urban Stormwater
Capturing urban runoff for beneficial use:
- **Spreading grounds**: Directing stormwater to percolation basins
- **Injection wells**: Direct aquifer recharge
- **Cisterns and rain barrels**: On-site storage
- **Green infrastructure**: Bioswales, permeable surfaces, rain gardens

### Regional Projects
- Los Angeles County Flood Control District stormwater capture
- Orange County stormwater recharge programs
- San Francisco Bay Area green infrastructure initiatives

### Regulatory Support
- MS4 permits encouraging capture and reuse
- Proposition 1 and 68 funding
- Low Impact Development requirements
- Water quality treatment requirements

### Potential
Studies estimate stormwater capture could add 580,000 to 1.4 million acre-feet annually statewide with full implementation.

## Groundwater Banking

### Conjunctive Use
Coordinating surface water and groundwater management:
- Storing surface water in aquifers during wet years
- Extracting during droughts
- Reducing aquifer overdraft
- Improving long-term sustainability

### Banking Operations
- **In-lieu recharge**: Using surface water instead of groundwater, allowing aquifer recovery
- **Direct recharge**: Spreading surface water for percolation
- **Injection**: Actively putting water into aquifers through wells
- **Recovery**: Extracting stored water when needed

### Major Groundwater Banks
- Kern Water Bank (largest in California)
- Semitropic Water Storage District
- Arvin-Edison Water Storage District
- Central Valley conjunctive use programs

### SGMA Integration
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act requires:
- Coordination with groundwater banks
- Sustainable yield accounting
- Recharge project prioritization
- Banking agreements with neighboring basins

## Surface Storage Enhancement

### New Storage Projects
Several major storage projects under development:
- **Sites Reservoir**: Proposed 1.5 million acre-foot off-stream reservoir
- **Temperance Flat**: Proposed expansion of Millerton Lake
- **Los Vaqueros Expansion**: Increasing existing reservoir capacity
- **Pacheco Reservoir**: Proposed new reservoir in Santa Clara County

### Existing Infrastructure Optimization
Maximizing current storage capacity:
- Operational flexibility improvements
- Dam safety upgrades enabling fuller storage
- Forecast-informed reservoir operations
- Coordination between storage facilities

## Water Transfers and Markets

### Temporary Transfers
Moving water from areas with surplus to areas of need:
- Agricultural-to-urban transfers during drought
- Environmental water purchases
- Regional exchange agreements

### Permanent Transfers
Long-term water supply arrangements:
- Water rights acquisitions
- Infrastructure partnerships
- Regional supply agreements

### Market Mechanisms
- Water banks facilitating trades
- Environmental water markets
- Groundwater substitution transfers
- Drought water banks

## Watershed Management

### Forest Health
Improving source water reliability:
- Forest thinning to reduce fire risk
- Meadow restoration for water storage
- Reducing sedimentation in reservoirs
- Protecting headwaters

### Source Water Protection
- Land conservation in watersheds
- Agricultural best management practices
- Wildfire response and recovery
- Erosion control

## Implementation Considerations

### Portfolio Approach
Successful diversification combines multiple strategies:
- No single source provides complete reliability
- Local conditions determine optimal mix
- Regional coordination improves efficiency
- Flexibility enables adaptive response

### Costs and Financing
- Varying costs per acre-foot by supply type
- State and federal funding programs
- Rate structures supporting investment
- Long-term financing mechanisms

### Environmental and Social Factors
- Environmental justice considerations
- Ecosystem impacts of supply development
- Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions
- Community engagement and acceptance
