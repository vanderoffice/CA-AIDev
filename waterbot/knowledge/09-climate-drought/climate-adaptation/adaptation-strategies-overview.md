# California Climate Adaptation Strategy Overview

## Framework and Policy Foundation

California's approach to climate adaptation in the water sector is guided by the California Climate Adaptation Strategy, a comprehensive framework updated regularly to address evolving climate challenges. The strategy integrates water management with broader climate resilience goals across all state sectors.

## Guiding Principles

### Integrated Water Management
- **Systems thinking**: Recognizing interconnections between surface water, groundwater, ecosystems, and human uses
- **Multi-benefit solutions**: Prioritizing projects that address multiple challenges simultaneously
- **Regional coordination**: Encouraging watershed-scale planning and implementation
- **Equity considerations**: Ensuring disadvantaged communities receive adaptation benefits

### Nature-Based Solutions
California increasingly emphasizes nature-based solutions as cost-effective, multi-benefit adaptation strategies:

- **Floodplain restoration**: Reconnecting rivers to floodplains for flood attenuation and groundwater recharge
- **Wetland enhancement**: Restoring coastal and inland wetlands for water quality, habitat, and flood protection
- **Watershed restoration**: Improving forest health and meadow function for water supply reliability
- **Urban greening**: Implementing green infrastructure for stormwater management and cooling

## State Climate Initiatives

### California Climate Adaptation Strategy
The state's overarching climate adaptation plan establishes priorities across sectors:
- Updated every three years with latest climate science
- Coordinates action across state agencies
- Tracks progress toward adaptation goals
- Integrates with California's climate assessment reports

### Water Resilience Portfolio
Executive Order N-10-19 directed development of a comprehensive water resilience portfolio addressing:
- Supply diversification
- Ecosystem restoration
- Flood management
- Groundwater sustainability
- Water quality protection

### Climate Bonds and Funding
Major funding mechanisms support implementation:
- **Proposition 4 (2024)**: $10 billion climate bond including significant water investments
- **Proposition 1 (2014)**: $7.5 billion water bond
- **Integrated Regional Water Management**: Competitive grants for regional projects
- **State Revolving Funds**: Low-interest financing for water infrastructure

## Regulatory Integration

Climate adaptation is increasingly integrated into existing regulatory programs:

### Water Rights Administration
- Drought contingency planning requirements
- Curtailment procedures incorporating climate projections
- Water availability analyses using updated hydrology

### Permitting and Planning
- Climate vulnerability assessments for major projects
- Sea level rise considerations for coastal facilities
- Fire risk evaluation for watershed management

### Groundwater Sustainability
- Climate change projections required in Groundwater Sustainability Plans
- Sustainable yield calculations incorporating climate scenarios
- Monitoring networks designed for long-term climate tracking

## Regional and Local Implementation

### Integrated Regional Water Management
Regional partnerships develop and implement climate adaptation strategies:
- 48 Integrated Regional Water Management regions statewide
- Coordinated project prioritization
- Regional climate vulnerability assessments
- Multi-agency collaboration

### Urban Water Management Plans
Urban water suppliers must address climate adaptation:
- Drought Risk Assessment (mandatory since 2020)
- Water Shortage Contingency Plans
- Long-range supply reliability analysis
- Climate change impact evaluation

## Monitoring and Assessment

### California Climate Assessment
Regular statewide assessments inform adaptation planning:
- Regional climate projections
- Sector-specific impact analysis
- Vulnerability identification
- Adaptation strategy evaluation

### Tracking Progress
State agencies monitor adaptation implementation:
- Climate adaptation indicator tracking
- Project outcome monitoring
- Adaptive management protocols
- Research coordination

## Cross-Sector Coordination

Water sector adaptation connects with other climate strategies:

### Land Use Planning
- Sustainable Communities Strategies
- General Plan Safety Elements
- Floodplain management
- Fire hazard planning

### Energy Sector
- Hydropower reliability
- Water-energy nexus
- Renewable energy-water tradeoffs
- Pumping efficiency

### Agriculture
- Irrigation efficiency
- Crop adaptation
- Soil health
- Agricultural water management plans

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Key Challenges
- Uncertainty in climate projections
- Funding gaps for implementation
- Institutional barriers to coordination
- Balancing competing water demands
- Addressing legacy infrastructure

### Emerging Opportunities
- Advancing monitoring technology
- Growing climate finance
- Increased public awareness
- Federal infrastructure investment
- Innovation in water technology
