# Agricultural Water Management Plans

## Context

Agriculture accounts for approximately 80% of water consumption in California, making agricultural water management critical to statewide sustainability.

## Statutory Basis

Agricultural Water Management Planning Act: Water Code Division 6 Part 2.8

## Applicability

### Required

Agricultural water suppliers serving **10,000 or more irrigated acres** must prepare and adopt Agricultural Water Management Plans.

### Exempt

Suppliers serving **less than 25,000 irrigated acres** NOT required unless sufficient funding specifically provided for that purpose.

### Bureau of Reclamation Alternative

Agricultural water suppliers contracting with USBR may submit Bureau-accepted water conservation plan with applicable addendums to satisfy state requirements.

## Update Cycle

Updated on or before April 1 in years ending in 6 and 1 (different from UWMP 5/0 cycle).

## Grant/Loan Eligibility

Agricultural water suppliers NOT eligible for state water grants or loans unless:
- AWMP adopted
- Required efficient water management practices implemented

## Required Plan Components

### Service Area Description

- Size and location
- Terrain and soils
- Climate
- Operating rules and regulations
- Water delivery measurements
- Water rate schedules
- Water shortage allocation policies

### Water Resources

- Surface water supply quantity and quality
- Groundwater supply quantity and quality
- Recycled water availability
- Other water sources
- Source water quality monitoring practices

### Water Uses

- Agricultural uses
- Environmental uses
- Recreational uses
- Municipal and industrial uses
- Groundwater recharge from irrigation seepage and deep percolation

### Annual Water Budget

Based on quantification of all inflow and outflow components:

**Inflow:**
- Surface inflow
- Groundwater pumping within service area
- Effective precipitation

**Outflow:**
- Surface outflow
- Deep percolation
- Evapotranspiration

### Climate Change Analysis

- Impacts on future water supplies
- Vulnerability assessment
- Adaptation considerations

### Water Management Objectives

Based on water budget to:
- Improve water system efficiency
- Meet other water management objectives

### Water Use Efficiency Quantification

Must use one of four DWR-developed methods to quantify efficiency.

### Efficient Water Management Practices (EWMPs)

Required practices under Water Code Section 10608.48:
- Irrigation efficiency improvements
- Soil moisture sensors and monitoring technologies
- Crop selection to reduce water consumption
- System maintenance to eliminate leaks

### EWMP Documentation

Must document:
- Which practices implemented
- Which practices planned (with schedules)
- If practice not locally cost-effective or technically feasible, provide justification

### Multi-Year Water Transfers

Address supply flexibility arrangements for drought resilience.

### Delta Consistency

Plans involving Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta must demonstrate consistency with Delta Plan Policy WR-P1 regarding:
- Reduced reliance on Delta
- Improved regional self-reliance

## Relationship to Groundwater Sustainability Plans

### SGMA Integration

Agricultural water suppliers must coordinate with:
- Groundwater Sustainability Agencies
- Groundwater Sustainability Plans
- Basin sustainability objectives

### Demand Management

Two main options for sustainable groundwater:
1. **Supply Augmentation** - Recharge projects, imported water
2. **Demand Management** - Reduce net groundwater pumping

Many GSAs focus on supply augmentation, but increasing droughts elevate importance of demand management.

### Demand Management Approaches

- Allocation systems limiting extraction
- Water efficiency improvements
- Conversion to less water-intensive uses

### Integrated Portfolios

Most robust approach combines both supply augmentation and demand management strategies.

## Agricultural Efficiency Improvements

### On-Farm Practices

- Drip and micro-irrigation systems
- Soil moisture monitoring
- Crop selection (less water-intensive varieties)
- Deficit irrigation strategies
- Improved irrigation scheduling

### Conveyance Efficiency

- Canal lining
- Pipeline conversion
- Leak detection and repair
- Measurement improvements

### System-Wide

- Water recycling and reuse
- Tailwater recovery
- Groundwater recharge programs

## Agricultural Drought Response

### Adaptation Strategies (from 2012-2016 drought)

When surface water reduced ~30%:
- ~2/3 replaced through additional groundwater pumping
- ~10% accommodated through fallowing (~500,000 acres)
- Remainder through stress irrigation and crop shifting

### Consequences of Groundwater Reliance

- Overdraft ~2.5 million acre-feet annually during drought
- Record land subsidence
- Unsustainable as long-term drought buffer
