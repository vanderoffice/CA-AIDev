# Urban Water Management Plans

## Statutory Basis

Urban Water Management Planning Act: California Water Code Sections 10610-10656

## Applicability

Required for every urban water supplier that either:
- Provides over 3,000 acre-feet of water annually, OR
- Serves more than 3,000 urban connections

Applies to both retail and wholesale water suppliers.

## Update Cycle

- Updated in years ending in 5 and 0 (every 5 years)
- Next deadline: July 1, 2026 (for 2025 plans)
- Submitted to Department of Water Resources

## Legislative Purpose

UWMPs ensure appropriate level of water service reliability sufficient to meet needs during:
- Normal water years
- Dry water years
- Multiple dry water year conditions

## Core Required Components

### Service Area Description

- Current and projected population
- Climate conditions
- Demographic and social factors

### Water Supply Sources

For each source, describe:
- Quantity available (5-year increments through planning horizon)
- Availability under normal, single dry, and 5-year drought
- Reliability considerations
- Climate change impacts

### Water Demand Analysis

- Existing and projected use by sector (municipal, commercial, industrial, irrigation)
- Documentation of changes in use patterns
- Baseline and target per capita water use
- Water Conservation Act compliance

### Water Service Reliability Assessment

20-year planning horizon comparing:
- Total available supply vs. total projected demand
- Normal year conditions
- Single dry year conditions
- Five consecutive dry year scenarios

### Climate Change Integration

Required under AB 1668 and SB 606 (2020 amendments):
- How climate change affects supply reliability
- Climate-informed demand projections
- Consideration of multiple climate scenarios

### Demand Management Measures

- Description of measures implemented or planned
- Quantification of expected water savings

### Water Shortage Contingency Plan

See separate file for detailed requirements.

### Recycled Water

- Current use of recycled water
- Planned expansion of recycled water

## Demand Projection Methodology

### Population Projections

Based on data from:
- California Department of Finance
- U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey
- Local agencies

### Factors to Consider

- Population growth as primary demand driver
- Economic conditions
- Land use patterns
- Water efficiency improvements
- Code and ordinance requirements

### Important Finding

Research shows 99% of UWMPs project population increases, but demand may decrease due to conservation measures - population growth doesn't automatically mean proportional water use increase.

## Supply Reliability Assessment

### Five-Year Drought Risk Assessment

Expanded requirement (2020 amendments):
- Analyze supply reliability during 5 consecutive dry years
- Identify shortage years and magnitude of deficits
- Describe response actions to address deficits
- Evaluate whether shortage contingency plan is sufficient

### Monthly Time Steps

Optional DWR planning tool structures analysis monthly to capture:
- Seasonal patterns of supply and demand
- Seasonal storage capacity
- Seasonal surface water flows

## Climate Change Requirements

### UWMP Guidebook Appendix I

Provides detailed guidance on climate change incorporation.

### Considerations

- Precipitation pattern changes
- Temperature increases
- Snowpack decline
- Streamflow alterations
- Evapotranspiration changes

### Sierra Nevada-Dependent Supplies

- Earlier snowmelt
- Reduced snowpack
- Altered seasonal flow patterns
- Compressed water availability periods

### Groundwater Supplies

- Altered recharge patterns
- SGMA compliance requirements
- Potential conflicts with sustainability objectives

## Consistency Requirements

### With Groundwater Sustainability Plans

UWMPs must be consistent with GSPs where applicable:
- Demonstrate groundwater extractions align with sustainable yield
- Show compliance with GSP management objectives
- Coordination between urban water suppliers and GSAs

### With IRWM Plans

Must demonstrate integration with regional water management plans.

## Water Supply Assessments (SB 610/SB 221)

### Applicability

Required for:
- Residential projects over 500 dwelling units
- Other major development projects exceeding size thresholds

### Requirements

- Verify adequate water supplies for project
- 20-year projection period
- Normal, single-dry, and multiple-dry year analysis
- Demonstrate consistency with UWMP and GSP

### Integration

Creates linkage between land use planning and water planning.

## Reporting

### Annual Water Supply and Demand Assessment

- Required beginning 2022
- Due by July 1 each year
- Submitted to DWR
- Evaluates anticipated shortage for coming year
- Assumes dry year conditions unless evidence otherwise

### Bulletin 161

DWR annual summary report aggregating results from all suppliers.
