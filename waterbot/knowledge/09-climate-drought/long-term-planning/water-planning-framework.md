# California Water Planning Framework

## California Water Plan (Bulletin 160)

### Overview

The California Water Plan is the state's overarching strategic document for managing water resources, updated every five years as required by Water Code Section 10005.

### Purpose

- Project status and trends of water supplies and demands
- Analyze future scenarios for planning
- Provide reference framework for local, regional, and statewide planning
- Inform policy and investment decisions

### Update 2023 Themes

Three intersecting and interdependent themes:
1. **Addressing Climate Urgency** - Climate change as primary planning driver
2. **Strengthening Watershed Resilience** - Building robust water systems
3. **Achieving Equity** - Fair distribution of water management benefits/burdens

### Planning Approach

- Multiple planning horizons and scenarios
- Recognition of uncertainty in climate, demographics, and regulations
- Regional analysis across California's hydrologic regions
- Watershed-scale vulnerability assessment

### Engagement Process

Update 2023 incorporated input from:
- Core state agencies
- Policy advisory committees
- Tribal advisory committees
- Public meetings and topic-based workshops
- Tribal nations (centuries of water management knowledge)

## Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM)

### Statutory Basis

Regional Water Management Planning Act (SB 1672, 2002) established IRWM framework.

### Funding

Over $2 billion in voter-approved bond funds through:
- Proposition 50
- Proposition 84
- Proposition 1E
- Proposition 1

### Coverage

- 48 regional water management groups
- 87% of state's area
- 99% of California's population

### Regional Organization

Groups bring together:
- Cities and counties
- Water agencies and special districts
- Non-governmental organizations
- Community and environmental groups
- Disadvantaged communities
- Tribal nations
- Other stakeholders

### IRWM Plan Requirements

Plans must address:
- Regional self-reliance strategies
- Reduced reliance on imported water
- Water supply and demand analysis
- Water quality conditions
- Climate change impacts and adaptation
- Consistency with UWMPs and GSPs
- Equity considerations
- Meaningful engagement of disadvantaged communities

### Grant Programs

**Planning Grants:**
- Develop, adopt, update IRWM plans
- Establish governance structures
- Engage diverse stakeholders

**Implementation Grants:**
- Over 800 regional water projects funded
- Water supply diversification
- Water quality improvement
- Watershed restoration
- Flood management
- Disadvantaged community support

**Disadvantaged Community/Tribal Grants:**
- Support identification and involvement of underrepresented communities
- Ensure authentic inclusion in planning processes

### Region Acceptance Process

- Evaluates proposed IRWM regions for grant eligibility
- Not a grant application itself
- Acceptance required for implementation grant funding
- Must demonstrate contiguous area, multiple agencies, integration of activities

## State Water Project and Central Valley Project

### State Water Project

- Built beginning in 1960s
- Over 700 miles from Lake Oroville to Southern California
- Delivers water to 27 million Californians
- Serves 750,000 acres of farmland

### Central Valley Project

- Federal project (Bureau of Reclamation)
- Coordinates with State Water Project
- Major water delivery to Central Valley agriculture

### Climate Change Impacts on Projects

- Designed for historical climate conditions
- Climate change reducing delivery reliability
- Up to 23% delivery reduction projected within 20 years
- Requires modernization and adaptation

## Water Resilience Portfolio (2020)

### Overview

Statewide roadmap for building water resilience through diverse actions.

### Four Goal Categories

1. **Maintaining and Diversifying Water Supplies**
   - Reduce reliance on single sources
   - Strengthen water security

2. **Protecting and Enhancing Natural Ecosystems**
   - Restore environmental health of river systems

3. **Building Connections**
   - Improve physical infrastructure
   - Store, move, share water more flexibly

4. **Integrating Water Management**
   - Share science, data, technology

### Annual Reporting

Progress reported annually to track implementation.

## Water Supply Strategy (2022)

### Focus Areas

How California will develop additional supplies through:
- Improved efficiency
- Recycled water expansion
- Groundwater management
- Stormwater capture

### Goal

Enhance resilience to climate change-induced supply variability.

## State Adaptation Strategy

### Update Cycle

Updated every three years since 2021.

### Scope

Addresses how California will adapt to climate impacts including changes to water supplies.
