# California Water Boards Enforcement Overview

## Legal Authority

### Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (1969)
The foundational state law providing enforcement authority to the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs). Applies to:
- Surface water and groundwater
- Wetlands
- Point and nonpoint pollution sources

### Clean Water Act
Federal authority under Section 309 operates concurrently with state enforcement. EPA can:
- Notify violators and states of violations
- Issue compliance orders if state action is insufficient
- Bring civil actions ($25,000/day penalty cap)
- Pursue criminal penalties for knowing violations

## Organizational Structure

### State Water Resources Control Board
- Five full-time salaried members (Governor-appointed, Senate-confirmed)
- Statewide guidance and oversight
- Water rights enforcement authority
- Houses the Office of Enforcement (established 2006)

### Office of Enforcement
Specialized units include:
- Legal staff (attorneys for enforcement strategy and prosecution)
- Cannabis Enforcement Unit (CEU)
- Underground Storage Tanks (UST) Enforcement Unit
- Special Investigation Unit
- Fraud, Waste and Abuse Prevention Unit

### Regional Water Quality Control Boards (9 total)
- Seven part-time members each (Governor-appointed, Senate-confirmed)
- Primary responsibility for water quality enforcement in their regions

- Issue waste discharge requirements
- Monitor water quality

## Progressive Enforcement Philosophy

### Core Principle
Escalating series of actions designed to achieve compliance:
1. Notification and compliance assistance
2. Enforcement orders compelling compliance
3. Civil liability complaints and formal enforcement

### When Progressive Enforcement Applies
- When enforcement is discretionary (not mandatory minimum penalties)
- Violations not caused by intentional or grossly negligent misconduct
- Impacts to beneficial uses are moderate or less
- Violator demonstrates commitment to achieving compliance

### When Progressive Enforcement Does NOT Apply
- Mandatory Minimum Penalty situations
- Intentional or grossly negligent misconduct
- Major impacts to beneficial uses
- Recalcitrant violators with history of non-compliance

## Enforcement Discretion Factors

When determining appropriate enforcement response, boards consider:

### Violation Characteristics
- Nature, circumstance, extent, and gravity
- Susceptibility to cleanup or abatement
- Degree of toxicity
- Impact on beneficial uses

### Violator Factors
- Ability to pay
- Effect on ability to continue in business
- Voluntary cleanup efforts
- Prior history of violations
- Degree of culpability

### Economic Considerations
- Economic benefit or savings from violations
- Cost of compliance vs. penalty amount

### Other Factors
- Strength of evidence
- Available enforcement resources
- EPA expectations for NPDES enforcement
- Watershed priorities
