# Informal Enforcement Actions

## Overview

Informal enforcement constitutes the initial response for most violations under California's progressive enforcement philosophy. These actions document violations and provide guidance without formal legal proceedings or financial penalties.

## Types of Informal Actions

### Oral Communications
- Phone calls to dischargers
- Site visit discussions
- Technical guidance conversations
- Initial problem notification

### Written Communications

#### Staff Enforcement Letters
- Formal notification of detected problems
- Detailed explanation of violations
- Reference to applicable legal requirements
- Technical guidance and compliance resources
- Creates regulatory record

#### Compliance Letters
- Direction regarding compliance obligations
- Deadlines for corrective action
- Resources available for assistance

### Notices of Violation (NOVs)

NOVs serve as a bridge between informal and formal enforcement:

**Purpose:**
- Alert violators to identified problems
- Provide opportunity to comply before formal action
- Document violations in regulatory record
- Create formal notice that Water Board is aware of issues

**For Water Rights Violations:**
- First enforcement step before CDOs or penalties
- Division of Water Rights maintains watershed-specific NOV lists
- Many violations resolved without further action
- Required step before imposing penalties

**Characteristics:**
- More formal than staff letters
- Documents specific violations and dates
- References applicable permits/orders
- Sets expectations for response

### Technical Assistance Referrals
- Direction to compliance resources
- Training program information
- Technical service providers
- Small system assistance programs

## When Informal Enforcement Is Appropriate

### Favorable Conditions
- First-time violation
- Violator demonstrates good faith
- Violation has not caused substantial environmental harm
- Violation is not part of a pattern of recalcitrance
- Immediate corrective action is feasible
- Discharger commits to achieving compliance

### Small Communities
Timely informal enforcement is particularly important for:
- Small water systems
- Disadvantaged community facilities
- Publicly owned treatment works serving small populations

**Rationale:** Early intervention allows facilities to address issues before large liabilities accumulate, improving likelihood of successful return to compliance.

## Documentation Requirements

All informal enforcement should:
- Be documented in regulatory files
- Include date of communication
- Describe violations identified
- Note any commitments made by discharger
- Track follow-up actions needed

## Escalation Triggers

Informal enforcement may escalate to formal action when:
- Violations continue after notice
- Discharger fails to respond
- New violations occur
- Pattern of non-compliance emerges
- Environmental harm increases
- Mandatory minimum penalties are triggered

## Stormwater Program Example

The stormwater program illustrates informal enforcement prevalence:
- Most violations addressed through informal enforcement
- Reduces burden on formal adjudication system
- Reserves formal action for serious/repeated violations
- Allows rapid response to emerging issues

## Effectiveness Measures

Informal enforcement success is measured by:
- Rate of compliance following notification
- Time to achieve compliance
- Reduction in repeat violations
- Prevention of escalation to formal enforcement
- General deterrent effect on regulated community

## Limitations

Informal enforcement alone is insufficient when:
- Violations are intentional
- Misconduct is grossly negligent
- Significant environmental harm has occurred
- Violator has history of non-compliance
- Mandatory penalties apply
- Rapid formal action is necessary to prevent ongoing harm
