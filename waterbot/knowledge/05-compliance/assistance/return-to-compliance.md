# Return to Compliance Pathways

## Overview

California Water Boards provide multiple mechanisms for systems to return to compliance, with pathway selection based on violation cause and system characteristics.

## Compliance Schedules

### Definition
Board-approved timeframes for achieving compliance with new or more stringent requirements.

### When Appropriate
- Must implement actions to achieve compliance
- Design and construct facilities
- Implement new programs
- Secure financing

### Requirements
- Compliance "as soon as possible"
- Reasonable time for necessary actions
- Maximum 10 years from adoption of water quality objective (with exceptions)

### Structure
- Interim milestones
- Progress reporting
- Final compliance deadline

## Corrective Action Plans

### Purpose
Enable systems to propose and implement remedial measures addressing violation causes.

### Plan Contents
- Identified deficiencies contributing to violations
- Targeted improvement strategies
- Implementation timeline
- Resource requirements

### Possible Focus Areas
- Water treatment improvements
- Distribution system upgrades
- Monitoring procedure changes
- Record-keeping improvements
- Operator training and certification

### Board Review
- Plan submitted for approval
- Must demonstrate realistic pathway to compliance
- Board-specified deadlines (or 120 days from notification)

## Notices of Violation (NOVs)

### Purpose
Formal acknowledgment alerting violators to problems before escalated enforcement.

### Process
1. Water Board issues NOV
2. Violator receives opportunity to comply
3. Many violations resolved without further action
4. Escalation only if compliance not achieved

### Effect
Creates regulatory record while providing compliance opportunity.

## Information Orders

### Purpose
Require violators to submit information helping Board understand:
- Violation causes
- System conditions
- Capacity issues

### Use
Precedes more intensive enforcement when additional information needed.

## Time Schedule Orders (TSOs)

### Definition
Board orders establishing compliance deadlines with potential conditional penalties.

### Relationship to Compliance
- During active TSO, may be exempt from some MMPs
- Must meet TSO milestones
- Missing milestones triggers separate violation

### TSO Requirements
- Approved pollution prevention plan implementation
- All reasonable and immediately feasible actions taken
- Progress toward compliance demonstrated

## Mandatory Consolidation

### When Used
Systems persistently fail to comply despite available assistance.

### Process
1. Division of Drinking Water issues consolidation letter
2. Non-compliant system required to consolidate or seek service extension
3. Structured timeframe provided
4. State support available throughout

### Rationale
- Removes chronically failing systems from operation
- Ensures service continuity to residents
- Eliminates ongoing compliance crises

## Water System Administrator Appointments

### When Appointed
- System serving disadvantaged community
- Consistently failed to provide adequate, affordable, safe water
- Despite available assistance

### Administrator Authority
- Full or limited scope managerial control
- Funded through SAFER program

### Process
1. System notification
2. Public notification and meeting
3. Public input on proposed administrator
4. Scoping and funding development
5. Formal Administrator Order
6. Implementation with community accountability plan
7. Transition to sustainable governance

### Goal
Temporary intervention until community develops capacity for independent governance.

## Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs)

### Definition
Environmentally beneficial projects undertaken in lieu of portions of monetary penalties.

### Requirements
- Must improve, protect, or reduce risks to public health/environment
- Not otherwise legally mandated
- Related to violation location (preferred)
- Adequate timetables and accounting
- Third-party administration typical

### Disadvantaged Community Priority
- AB 1071 requires SEP policy benefiting DACs
- Up to 50% of penalty can go to DAC-benefiting SEP (vs. typical 25%)

### Potential SEP Types
- Water treatment improvements in DACs
- Groundwater remediation
- Stream restoration
- Contaminant source projects

### Process
1. Parties submit SEP proposals (CalEPA SEP Proposal Form)
2. Proposals added to Potential SEP List
3. During settlement, appropriate SEP selected
4. Completion releases suspended liability
5. Non-completion triggers full penalty payment

## Financial Assistance for Return to Compliance

### Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF)
- Low-interest loans (half of GO bond rate)
- 30-year terms typical
- Principal forgiveness for DAC/SDAC projects

### Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF)
- Wastewater infrastructure
- Similar favorable terms

### CAA Urgent Drinking Water Need Projects
- Up to $500,000
- Emergency improvements
- Fast-moving compared to regular financing

### Direct O&M Funding
- Ongoing operational cost support
- Maintains affordable rates during improvements

## Progressive Enforcement Integration

### Classification
| Class | Description | Response |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| A | Immediate/significant threat | Prioritized enforcement |
| B | Moderate environmental impact | Assistance-first approach |

### Philosophy
- Begin with simplest remedies
- Expect appropriate responses will achieve compliance
- Reserve intensive enforcement for resistance to assistance

## Key Contacts for Assistance

### SAFER Engagement Unit
- Water resource engineers and specialists
- Sustainable drinking water solutions
- Partnership and consolidation support

### Regional Water Boards
- Local compliance assistance
- Community engagement
- Technical expertise

### Division of Financial Assistance
- Funding program guidance
- Application support
- Project management

## Summary: Compliance Pathway Selection

| System Situation | Recommended Pathway |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Can't afford improvements | Financial assistance + compliance schedule |
| Lacks technical capacity | Technical assistance + operator training |
| Governance problems | TMF assessment + administrator if needed |
| Non-viable system | Consolidation support |
| Actively resisting | Progressive enforcement |
