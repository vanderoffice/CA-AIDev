# Compliance Assistance Overview

## Philosophy

California Water Boards' compliance assistance emphasizes:
- **Prevention over punishment** - Build capacity before violations occur
- **Root cause solutions** - Address underlying barriers, not just symptoms
- **Tiered approach** - Distinguish systems that can't comply from those that won't
- **Human Right to Water** - Safe, affordable water is a fundamental right

## Legal Foundation

### California Human Right to Water
> "Every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes."

This principle reframes compliance from regulatory matter to human rights issue.

### Key Legislation
- **SB 1307 (1997)**: Established drinking water financial assistance and technical assistance for small systems
- **SB 200 (2019)**: Created Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund ($130M/year for 10 years)

## Compliance Assistance Hierarchy

### Progressive Approach
1. **Informal Assistance** - Technical guidance, training, resources
2. **Formal Assistance** - Compliance schedules, corrective action plans
3. **Intensive Support** - Administrator appointments, consolidation
4. **Enforcement** - Reserved for systems that won't comply despite assistance

### When Enforcement Applies
- Systems with capacity to comply that choose not to
- Repeated failure despite available assistance
- Recalcitrant parties deliberately avoiding compliance
