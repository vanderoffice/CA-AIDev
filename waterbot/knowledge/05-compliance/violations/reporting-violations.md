# Reporting and Monitoring Violations

## Self-Monitoring Report (SMR) Violations

### Late Report Violations
Reports not submitted by permit-specified deadline constitute violations.

**Timing Classification:**
| Days Late | Classification |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1-30 days | Late report violation |
| 31-60 days | Late + 1 serious violation |
| 61-90 days | Late + 2 serious violations |
| 91+ days | Late + continuing serious violations (per 30-day period) |

**Key Rule:** A serious violation is created for each complete 30-day period past the deadline.

### Multiple Violation Types
Late report violations and effluent violations are recorded **separately**:
- Late SMR = reporting violation
- Exceedance in the SMR = effluent violation
- Both violations counted; both may trigger MMPs

## Failure to Submit Reports

### Complete Non-Submission
When no report is submitted at all:
- Initial violation for failure to file
- Additional serious violations accumulate per 30-day period
- May trigger formal enforcement action
- Water Boards may conduct inspection to verify compliance

### Partial Non-Submission
When report covers some but not all required periods:
- Separate violation for each missing period
- Each missing report subject to escalating penalties

## Deficient Report Violations

### Common Deficiencies
Reports are deficient when missing required elements:

| Missing Element | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| Signature | Deficient report violation |
| Certification statement | Deficient report violation |
| Laboratory identification | Deficient report violation |
| Required notification | Deficient report violation |
| QA/QC documentation | Deficient report violation |
| Complete data sets | Deficient report violation |

### Incomplete Data
- Missing parameters that were required to be monitored
- Partial monitoring (some locations/times sampled, others not)
- Must explain why data is incomplete

### Errors in Reports
- Calculation errors
- Incorrect units
- Misidentified sampling locations
- May require amended report submission

## Failure to Monitor Violations

### Definition
Failure to conduct required monitoring as specified in permit or WDR.

### Discovery Methods
- Self-reported in SMR
- Discovered during inspection
- Revealed through CIWQS data review

### Recording Requirements
If monitoring not conducted AND not reported:
- Deficient monitoring violation recorded
- Separate from any reporting violation
- Both violations counted

### Common Monitoring Failures
- Missing sampling events
- Incomplete parameter coverage
- Improper sampling procedures
- Expired laboratory certifications
- Non-accredited laboratory use

## CIWQS Reporting Obligations

### Electronic Submittal Requirements
Many permits require electronic reporting through:
- CIWQS eSMR (electronic Self-Monitoring Report)
- NetDMR (EPA's National Discharge Monitoring Report system)

### Submittal Deadlines
Specified in each permit; typically:
- Monthly reports: 15th-30th of following month
- Quarterly reports: 30-45 days after quarter end
- Annual reports: 60-90 days after year end

### Data Validation
CIWQS performs automated checks for:
- Parameter completeness
- Value range reasonableness
- Unit consistency
- Limit comparisons

## False Data and Misrepresentation

### Falsification Violations
Intentionally false statements in reports are subject to:
- Civil penalty up to $10,000 per occurrence
- Criminal referral possible
- Any public prosecutor can bring action

### What Constitutes Falsification
- Fabricated monitoring data
- Altered laboratory results
- False certifications
- Deliberately misleading information
- Omitting required adverse data

### Certification Requirements
SMRs must include certification statement signed by responsible official:

> "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information submitted..."

### Consequences
- CWC 13385.1: Up to $10,000 civil penalty for knowing false statements
- Potential criminal prosecution
- Permit revocation consideration
- Enhanced enforcement attention for all future submissions

## Priority Violation Designation

### When Reporting Violations Are Priority
- Late by >30 days (triggers serious violation status)
- Pattern of late reporting
- Associated with substantive permit violations
- Part of chronic violation accumulation

### Documentation Requirements
When marking as priority:
- Due date documented
- Actual submission date documented
- Period of lateness calculated
- Any aggravating factors noted

## Inspection-Discovered Violations

### When Monitoring Issues Found During Inspection
If Water Boards discover through inspection that:
- Required monitoring was not performed
- Monitoring was performed improperly
- Records don't match reported data

**Result:** Deficient monitoring violation recorded in addition to any reporting violation.

### Record Retention Requirements
Permits typically require:
- 3-5 years retention of monitoring records
- Laboratory reports and chain of custody
- Calibration records
- QA/QC documentation

### Failure to Maintain Records
Separate violation category for:
- Missing required records
- Inadequate record-keeping systems
- Inability to produce records during inspection

## Chronic Violation Interaction

### Counting Toward Chronic Threshold
Reporting violations count toward the 4-in-6-months chronic threshold:
- Failure to file required report
- Filing incomplete report
- Combined with effluent violations

### Example Scenario
Month 1: Late SMR (1 violation)
Month 2: Effluent exceedance (2 violations)
Month 4: Missing parameter (3 violations)
Month 5: Late SMR (4 violations) → Chronic threshold met → $3,000 MMP
