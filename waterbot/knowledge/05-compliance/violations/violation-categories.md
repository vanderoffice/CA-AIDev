# Violation Categories and Classification

## Current Classification System (2017+)

### Class A Violations (Highest Priority)
Violations that potentially pose an immediate and substantial threat to beneficial uses OR have potential to cause significant detrimental impacts to human health or environment.

**Class A Examples:**
- Discharges causing exceedances of primary MCLs in MUN-designated waters
- Unauthorized sewage discharges within 1,000 feet of municipal water intake
- Priority pollutant exceedances ≥100% over water quality-based limits
- Demonstrable detrimental impacts to aquatic life (fish kills)
- Numeric acute toxicity limit violations
- Unauthorized discharges from Class II surface impoundments
- Unpermitted wetland fill >0.5 acre
- Construction material discharges to waters with fish beneficial uses
- Turbidity >100 NTU in fish waters (except during storms)
- **Recalcitrant parties** deliberately avoiding compliance

### Class B Violations
All violations that do not meet Class A criteria. Represent moderate threats requiring proportional enforcement response.

## Legacy Classification (Pre-2017)

### Class I Violations
Immediate and substantial threat to water quality with potential for significant detrimental impacts to human health or environment.

### Class II Violations
Moderate, indirect, or cumulative threat to water quality. Includes:
- Negligent or inadvertent noncompliance
- Potential for causing unauthorized discharge
- Potential for obscuring past violations

### Class III Violations
Minor threat to water quality with little/no potential for detrimental impact. Includes:
- Late reporting (when not causing/allowing unauthorized discharge)

## Serious Violations (CWC 13385(h))

### Definition
A waste discharge that violates effluent limitations:

| Pollutant Group | Exceedance Threshold |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Group I | ≥40% over limit |
| Group II | ≥20% over limit |

### Group I Pollutants (Priority Pollutants)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
- Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
- Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
- Priority pollutants (aluminum, cobalt, iron, vanadium, certain metals)
- Generally more hazardous and environmentally persistent

### Group II Pollutants (Toxic Pollutants)
- Metals not listed under Group I
- Cyanide
- Total residual chlorine
- Organic pollutants not under Group I

### Additional Serious Violation Trigger
Late discharge monitoring report:
- Separate serious violation for each complete 30-day period past deadline
- Report must be designed to ensure compliance with effluent limitations

## Chronic Violations (CWC 13385(i))

### Definition
Four or more violations in any 6-consecutive-month period of:
- Effluent limitation violations
- Failure to file required reports
- Filing incomplete reports
- Toxicity effluent limitation violations

### Key Rules
- 6-month period: 180 days from first violation date
- First three violations NOT subject to MMP
- Fourth and subsequent violations trigger $3,000 MMP each
- Applies regardless of exceedance magnitude

### Example
A facility exceeds Group II limit by 15% (not serious individually):
- Violation 1 (Jan 5): No MMP
- Violation 2 (Feb 12): No MMP
- Violation 3 (Mar 20): No MMP
- Violation 4 (May 1): $3,000 MMP
- Violation 5 (June 15): $3,000 MMP

## Priority Violation Criteria

Violations must be marked as "Priority" to appear on enforcement reports. Priority violations include:

1. **EPA-Required QNCR Violations**
   - Quarterly Non-Compliance Report submissions to EPA
   - Significant non-compliance tracking

2. **Mandatory Minimum Penalty Violations**
   - All CWC 13385 serious/chronic violations

3. **Regional/State Board Designated**
   - Other violations considered significant by Water Boards

## On-Time Compliance (OTC) Determinations

### Purpose
Assess whether facilities meet compliance schedules and permit requirements on time.

### Factors Considered
- Meeting interim milestones
- Progress toward final compliance
- Good faith efforts
- Documentation of compliance activities

### Implications
- Positive OTC: May support compliance schedule extensions
- Negative OTC: May trigger escalated enforcement

## Violation Recording Standards

### Documentation Timeline
All violations must be entered in CIWQS within **10 days of discovery**

### Required Description Elements
- Report period (e.g., 1stQ = first quarter)
- Constituent name
- Permit limit value
- Units
- Limitation period (D=daily, W=weekly, M=monthly)
- Actual result

### Example Description Format
```
(1stQ; TDS; 450; mg/L; M; 800)
```
Meaning: First Quarter, Total Dissolved Solids, 450 mg/L monthly limit, actual result 800 mg/L
