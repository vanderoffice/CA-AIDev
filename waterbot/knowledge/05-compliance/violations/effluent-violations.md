# Effluent Limit Violations

## Overview

Effluent limit violations are the most common violation type, occurring when discharge monitoring results exceed permit limits. These represent the core of NPDES permit enforcement.

## Limit Types and Measurement Periods

### Daily Maximum Limits
- **Purpose:** Protect against acute toxicity and immediate water quality impacts
- **Measurement:** Single sample or composite sample results
- **Violation Recording:** One violation for each day limit is exceeded
- **Example:** If daily max is violated on 3 days in a month, record 3 violations

### Weekly Average Limits
- **Purpose:** Smooth out daily variation while responding to sustained elevations
- **Measurement:** Average of samples collected during the week
- **Violation Recording:** One violation for each week limit is exceeded

### Monthly Average Limits
- **Purpose:** Reflect long-term pollutant loading and cumulative effects
- **Measurement:** Average of all samples collected during the month
- **Violation Recording:** One violation for each month limit is exceeded

### Instantaneous Maximum Limits
- **Purpose:** Prevent any short-term exceedance regardless of averaging
- **Measurement:** Typically continuous monitoring
- **Violation Recording:** At most one violation per day

## Multiple Limit Violations

When a single discharge event exceeds multiple limit types, **each is recorded separately**:

| Scenario | Violations Recorded |
|----------|-------------------|
| Exceeds daily max only | 1 violation |
| Exceeds daily max + monthly avg | 2 violations |
| Exceeds daily max + weekly + monthly | 3 violations |
| Exceeds both CAT1 and CAT2 limit | 2 violations |

## Concentration-Based vs Mass-Based Limits

### Concentration-Based Limits
- **Expression:** mg/L, μg/L, other concentration units
- **What it controls:** Pollutant concentration regardless of volume
- **Best used for:** Direct toxicity concerns, drinking water protection
- **Example:** Copper ≤ 10 μg/L

### Mass-Based Limits
- **Expression:** lbs/day, kg/day
- **What it controls:** Total quantity discharged per unit time
- **Calculation:** Concentration × Flow × Conversion Factor
- **Best used for:** Variable flow facilities, cumulative loading concerns
- **Example:** Total nitrogen ≤ 500 lbs/day

### When Both Apply
Some permits include both concentration and mass limits for the same parameter. Both must be met; exceeding either constitutes a violation.

## Violation Categories in CIWQS

### CAT1 Violations (Group I Pollutants)
- BOD, COD, TSS
- Priority pollutants
- Require separate entry for each violation
- Higher serious violation threshold (40%)

### CAT2 Violations (Group II Pollutants)
- Metals not in Group I
- Cyanide, total residual chlorine
- Most organic pollutants
- Lower serious violation threshold (20%)

## Special Parameter Violations

### pH Violations
- Cannot be expressed as mass
- Typically permitted range (e.g., 6.5-8.5)
- Values outside range = violation
- Each instance recorded separately

### Temperature Violations
- Expressed in degrees (°C or °F)
- Based on receiving water thermal standards
- Particularly important for cold water fisheries

### Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- Minimum limits to protect aquatic life
- Falling below minimum = violation
- Critical for fish and invertebrate survival

## Toxicity Violations

### Acute Toxicity
- Tests lethal/severe effects over 48-96 hours
- Uses standardized test organisms (Daphnia, fathead minnow)
- Violation when >50% of organisms affected
- Typically Class A priority
- **One entry per failed acute test**

### Chronic Toxicity
- Tests sublethal effects over 7-28 days
- Measures growth, reproduction, behavior
- Expressed as % effluent causing no effect
- **One entry per failed chronic test**

## Serious Violation Thresholds

| Pollutant Group | Limit | Actual | % Exceedance | Serious? |
|-----------------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| Group I | 10 mg/L | 14 mg/L | 40% | YES |
| Group I | 10 mg/L | 13 mg/L | 30% | NO |
| Group II | 10 mg/L | 12 mg/L | 20% | YES |
| Group II | 10 mg/L | 11 mg/L | 10% | NO |

## Bypass and Upset Provisions

### Bypass
- Intentional diversion around treatment
- Must be unavoidable and report immediately
- Some bypasses may be permitted during maintenance

### Upset
- Exceptional incident causing unintentional noncompliance
- Beyond discharger's reasonable control
- Must demonstrate proper operation and maintenance
- Requires immediate notification

**Note:** These provisions may provide affirmative defense but don't eliminate violation recording requirement.

## Compliance Schedule Considerations

When facility is under Time Schedule Order:
- Interim limits may apply instead of final limits
- Violations measured against applicable interim limits
- Progress toward final compliance tracked
- Missing milestones triggers separate violations

## Violation Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Single Parameter
**Permit:** Copper daily max = 20 μg/L
**Result:** Sample shows 28 μg/L
**Calculation:** (28-20)/20 = 40% exceedance
**Classification:** Group I (metal) → Serious violation at 40%
**MMP:** $3,000

### Example 2: Multiple Days
**Permit:** TSS daily max = 30 mg/L
**Results over 5 days:** 32, 45, 28, 50, 29 mg/L
**Violations:** 3 days exceeded (days with 32, 45, 50)
**Check for chronic:** If part of 4+ violations in 6 months
