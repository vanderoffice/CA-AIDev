# Self-Monitoring Report (SMR) Requirements

## Legal Authority

### Federal
- 40 CFR §122.48: All NPDES permits must specify monitoring and reporting requirements
- Clean Water Act: Permits must include monitoring to assure compliance

### California
- CWC 13267: Authority for monitoring and reporting requirements
- CWC 13383: Reporting requirements for waste dischargers

## SMR Components

### Facility Identification
- Facility name
- WDID (Waste Discharger Identification number)
- Legally Responsible Person (LRP) name and title
- Contact information

### Monitoring Data
For each parameter and location:
- Date and time of sampling
- Analytical result value
- Units of measurement
- Analytical method used
- Minimum Level (ML)
- Method Detection Limit (MDL)

### Calculated Values
- Monthly averages
- Daily maximums
- Mass loading rates (lbs/day)
- Percent removal efficiencies

### Narrative Elements
- Explanation of any limit exceedances
- Corrective actions taken
- Deviations from standard monitoring program

## Reporting Periods

| Period | Report Due | Typical Programs |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Monthly | 15-30 days after month end | Major NPDES |
| Quarterly | 30-45 days after quarter end | Minor NPDES, aggregate mining |
| Semi-annual | 30-45 days after period end | Low-risk discharges |
| Annual | 60-90 days after year end | Summary reports |

## Non-Detect Reporting

### Not Detected (ND)
- Result below Method Detection Limit
- Report as "ND"
- For calculations: Use ½ of MDL

### Detected but Not Quantified (DNQ)
- Above MDL but below Reporting Level
- Report as "DNQ"
- Include estimated concentration

### NODI Codes (No Data/Information)
Used when data unavailable:
- Failed to Sample
- Below Detection Limit
- No discharge during period

## Quality Requirements

### Analytical Methods
- Must comply with 40 CFR Part 136
- EPA-approved methods required
- Method specified in permit

### Laboratory Requirements
- Must use ELAP-accredited laboratory
- Lab must be certified for specific method/parameter
- Non-accredited lab results may be rejected

### Detection Limits
- Minimum Level (ML): Lowest quantifiable concentration
- Method Detection Limit (MDL): Lowest detectable concentration
- Must be reported with each result

## Certification Statement

SMRs must include signed certification:

> "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information submitted..."

### Legal Consequences
- False statements: Up to $10,000 penalty per occurrence
- Criminal referral possible for willful falsification
- LRP personally liable for accuracy

## Record Retention

### Minimum Period
Typically **3 years** from record creation date for:
- All monitoring information
- Calibration records
- Strip charts
- Data used for calculations
- Chain of custody forms

### Access Requirements
- Must be readily available for inspection
- Water Boards may conduct audits
- EPA may request records

## Monitoring and Reporting Program (MRP)

### Definition
Permit attachment (often Attachment E) that specifies:
- What parameters to monitor
- Monitoring locations
- Required frequencies
- Analytical methods
- Report formats

### Approval
- Approved by Regional Board Executive Officer
- Binding part of permit
- Modifications require approval

## Parameter Categories by Permit Type

### Municipal Wastewater (NPDES)
- BOD, TSS, Ammonia-N, Total N, Phosphorus
- pH, DO, Temperature, Conductivity
- Fecal coliform/Enterococcus
- Chlorine residual, UV dose
- Metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, etc.)
- Percent removal (BOD, TSS ≥85%)

### Industrial NPDES
- Priority pollutants
- Industry-specific parameters
- Whole Effluent Toxicity

### Stormwater
- pH, TSS, Oils/grease
- Storm event-triggered monitoring
- First flush sampling

### Aggregate Mining
- Flow, pH, TSS, Turbidity
- Quarterly reports
- Annual summaries

## Accelerated Monitoring

### Trigger
Effluent limit exceedance

### Effect
| Normal Frequency | Accelerated To |
|------------------|----------------|
| Monthly | Weekly |
| Quarterly | Monthly |
| Semi-annual | Quarterly |

### Duration
Until 3 consecutive compliant samples, then return to normal frequency with Executive Officer approval
