## Penalty Types

### Mandatory Minimum Penalties (MMPs)
- Fixed $3,000 per qualifying violation
- Non-discretionary - Water Boards MUST assess
- Apply to serious violations and chronic violations
- Cannot be waived except under narrow statutory exceptions

### Discretionary Penalties
- Calculated using 10-step methodology
- Subject to adjustment factors
- Can be reduced based on circumstances
- Must recover at least economic benefit + 10%

## Penalty Calculation Factors (CWC 13385(e))

When determining penalty amounts, Water Boards must consider:

1. **Nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity** of violation
2. **Susceptibility to cleanup or abatement**
3. **Degree of toxicity** of discharge
4. **Ability to pay**
5. **Effect on ability to continue in business**
6. **Voluntary cleanup efforts** undertaken
7. **Prior history of violations**
8. **Degree of culpability**
9. **Economic benefit or savings** from violation
10. **Other matters** as justice may require

## Economic Benefit Recovery

### Requirement
Penalties must recover the economic benefit gained from non-compliance.

### What Constitutes Economic Benefit
- Avoided capital costs (equipment not purchased)
- Avoided operational costs (not running controls)
- Avoided monitoring costs
- Delayed capital improvements (time value of money)
- Competitive advantage over compliant dischargers

### BEN Model
EPA's Benefit and Economic Noncompliance model calculates:
- Present value of avoided costs
- Interest earned on money not spent on compliance
- Time value adjustments

## Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs)

### Definition
Environmentally beneficial projects undertaken with Water Board approval as alternative to monetary penalties.

### Statutory Authority
CWC 13385(l)

### Amount Limits
| Penalty Amount | SEP Maximum |
|----------------|-------------|
