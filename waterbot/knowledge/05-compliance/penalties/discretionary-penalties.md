# Discretionary Penalty Calculation Methodology

## Overview

When penalties exceed mandatory minimums or MMPs don't apply, Water Boards use a 10-step methodology from the 2024 Enforcement Policy to calculate appropriate civil liability.

## Step 1: Actual or Potential Harm Assessment

### Harm to Beneficial Uses (0-5 scale)
| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Negligible | No measurable impact |
| 1 | Minor | Slight, temporary impact |
| 2 | Below Moderate | Limited impact, quick recovery |
| 3 | Moderate | Noticeable impact, moderate recovery time |
| 4 | Above Moderate | Significant impact, extended recovery |
| 5 | Major | Severe impact, long-term damage |

### Deviation from Requirements
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Minor | Barely exceeds requirements |
| Moderate | Significantly exceeds requirements |
| Major | Substantially exceeds or violates prohibitions |

### Toxicity Assessment (0-4 scale)
Based on:
- Pollutant characteristics
- Bioaccumulation potential
- Environmental persistence
- Priority pollutant status

### Susceptibility to Cleanup
- Higher scores for discharges NOT susceptible to cleanup
- Groundwater contamination = less susceptible
- Surface spill with immediate containment = more susceptible

## Step 2: Per Gallon and Per Day Assessments (Discharge Violations)

### Per Gallon Factors
- Range: $2.00 to $10.00 per gallon
- Applied to high-volume discharges (>100,000 gallons)
- Based on potential for harm score

### Per Day Factors
- Range: $1.00 to $10.00 per day
- Based on potential for harm score
- Applied to duration of violation

### Initial Liability Calculation
```
Initial Amount = (Gallons × Per Gallon Factor) + (Days × Per Day Factor)
```

**2024 Policy Note:** Be thoughtful when reducing per-gallon value to avoid incentivizing failure to mitigate discharge volume.

## Step 3: Per Day Assessments (Non-Discharge Violations)

For administrative violations (no actual discharge):
- Failure to submit monitoring reports
- Failure to implement BMPs
- Failure to obtain permits
- Other operational/administrative violations

Uses separate per-day factor table reflecting:
- Impact on regulatory oversight
- Ability to detect other violations
- Compliance monitoring compromise

## Step 4: Adjustment Factors

### Culpability (1.0 to 1.5 multiplier)
**2024 Policy: Minimum raised from 0.5 to 1.0**

| Score | Conduct |
|-------|---------|
| 1.0 | Accident beyond reasonable control |
| 1.1-1.2 | Some negligence, inadequate precautions |
| 1.3-1.4 | Negligent, poor maintenance, inadequate oversight |
| 1.5 | Intentional or grossly negligent conduct |

**Factors considered:**
- Degree of control over circumstances
- Adequacy of diligence in prevention
- Industry standards and practices

### Cleanup and Cooperation (0.75 to 1.5 multiplier)

| Score | Conduct |
|-------|---------|
| 0.75 | Extensive cleanup, prompt notification, full cooperation |
| 1.0 | Reasonable efforts, adequate cooperation |
| 1.25 | Minimal cleanup, slow response |
| 1.5 | No cleanup, failed to notify, unresponsive |

**2024 Policy Note:** Failure to respond to Water Board requests is culpable conduct considered in this analysis.

### History of Violations (≥1.0 multiplier)

| History | Multiplier |
|---------|------------|
| No prior violations | 1.0 |
| Prior violations exist | ≥1.1 |

**Key Rule:** This factor can NEVER be less than 1.0.

### Adjusted Base Liability Calculation
```
Adjusted Amount = Initial Amount × Culpability × Cleanup/Cooperation × History
```

## Step 5: Total Base Liability

Sum adjusted amounts for all violations in the case.

If multiple violations from single event:
- Calculate each separately
- Add together for total

## Step 6: Economic Benefit Assessment

### Requirement
Recover ALL economic benefit derived from violation.

### Types of Economic Benefit
- Avoided capital costs
- Avoided operational costs
- Avoided monitoring costs
- Delayed compliance costs (time value)
- Competitive advantage gained

### BEN Model Calculation
EPA's Benefit and Economic Noncompliance model calculates:
- Present value of avoided expenditures
- Interest on money not spent
- Time value adjustments

### Alternative Calculation
Direct estimation when BEN model not appropriate.

## Step 7: Other Factors as Justice May Require

Adjustments for case-specific circumstances:
- Staff investigation and enforcement costs
- Specific conduct warranting additional consideration
- Unique circumstances not captured in earlier steps

**Requirement:** Express findings must justify any adjustments.

## Step 8: Ability to Pay / Continue in Business

### When Applied
When calculated penalty exceeds discharger's capacity to pay OR would impair business continuity.

### Analysis Factors
- Financial statements
- Cash flow
- Existing debt obligations
- Rate base impact (for utilities)
- Ratepayer impact (for public systems)

### Disadvantaged Communities
- Cost of compliance creates undue burden
- May warrant significant reduction
- Consider alternative payment structures

**2024 Policy Note:** Decision makers have discretion to decline reduction based on this factor.

## Step 9: Maximum and Minimum Liability

### Minimum Floor
**Economic Benefit + 10%**

Ensures violator doesn't profit even with all reductions applied.

### Maximum Ceiling
| Enforcement Type | Per Day | Per Gallon |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Administrative (ACL) | $10,000 | $10 |
| Judicial (Superior Court) | $25,000 | $25 |

## Step 10: Final Liability Amount

Must fall between:
- **Floor:** Economic benefit + 10%
- **Ceiling:** Statutory maximum

Represents Water Board's determination reflecting all factors.

## Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Facility discharged 50,000 gallons over 5 days, moderate harm, no prior violations, cooperative response.

| Step | Calculation | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Harm score: 3 (moderate) | - |
| 2 | 50,000 gal × $4/gal + 5 days × $5,000/day | $225,000 |
| 4a | Culpability: 1.2 | × 1.2 |
| 4b | Cleanup: 0.9 (cooperative) | × 0.9 |
| 4c | History: 1.0 (none) | × 1.0 |
| 5 | $225,000 × 1.2 × 0.9 × 1.0 | $243,000 |
| 6 | Economic benefit: $30,000 | Add to consideration |
| 9 | Minimum: $30,000 × 1.1 = $33,000 | Floor |
| 10 | Final: Between $33,000 and $243,000 | Board decision |

## 2024 Policy Environmental Justice Integration

### Priority Violations
- Drinking water resource contamination
- Impacts on disadvantaged communities

### Disadvantaged Community Definition
Median household income <80% of statewide median

### Considerations
- Direct SEP benefits to affected communities
- Consider cumulative impacts
- Prioritize enforcement protecting vulnerable populations
