# Mandatory Minimum Penalties (MMPs)

## Overview

Mandatory Minimum Penalties are non-discretionary penalties that Water Boards MUST assess for specified violation categories. The $3,000 per violation amount creates a baseline enforcement floor.

## MMP Amount
**$3,000 per qualifying violation**

Water Boards may assess MORE than $3,000 but cannot assess less.

## Serious Violation Triggers (CWC 13385(h))

### Effluent Limit Exceedances
| Pollutant Group | Threshold |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Group I (Priority Pollutants) | ≥40% over limit |
| Group II (Toxic Pollutants) | ≥20% over limit |

### Late Reporting (CWC 13385.1)
Failure to file a discharge monitoring report:
- For each complete 30-day period past deadline
- Report must be designed to ensure compliance with effluent limitations

**Example:** Report due January 15, submitted March 1 = 1 serious violation (45 days late = one complete 30-day period)

## Chronic Violation Triggers (CWC 13385(i))

### Definition
Four or more violations in any 6-consecutive-month period of:
- Effluent limitation violations
- Failure to file required reports
- Filing incomplete reports
- Toxicity effluent limitation violations

### MMP Application
- First three violations: No MMP
- Fourth violation: $3,000 MMP
- Fifth and subsequent: $3,000 MMP each

### 6-Month Window Calculation
- Begins on date of first violation
- Ends 180 days later
- Rolling window resets with each new violation

## Exemptions and Waivers

### Late Report Exemption (CWC 13385.1(a)(2)(A))
Discharger may avoid MMP if:
1. Submits written statement certifying NO discharges to waters of US during monitoring period
2. Provides reasons for late filing

**Warning:** Willfully false statements = up to $10,000 penalty

### Time Schedule Order Exemption (CWC 13385(f))
MMP may not apply during TSO period if:
- Discharger implementing approved pollution prevention plan
- Carried out all reasonable and immediately feasible actions
- Meeting TSO requirements

### Small Community Compliance Project (CWC 13385(k))
For POTWs serving small communities:
- Population ≤20,000, OR
- Rural county with financial hardship

May convert MMP to equivalent compliance project expenditure.

## Expedited Payment Process

### Purpose
Resolve uncontested MMP violations quickly without formal hearing.

### Process
1. Water Board identifies MMP violations
2. Issues Offer to Participate in Expedited Payment Letter Program
3. Discharger has 30 days to accept and pay
4. Public notice and comment period
5. Executive Officer executes Acceptance and Waiver
6. Payment submitted to State Water Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Account

### Benefits
- Faster resolution
- Lower administrative costs
- No formal hearing required
- Predictable outcome

## MMP Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Serious Violation (Effluent)
**Situation:** Group I pollutant limit = 10 mg/L, Actual = 15 mg/L
**Calculation:** (15-10)/10 = 50% exceedance
**Result:** Exceeds 40% threshold → $3,000 MMP

### Example 2: Chronic Violations
**Situation:** 6 effluent violations over 5 months (none serious individually)
- Month 1: Violation 1 - No MMP
- Month 2: Violation 2 - No MMP
- Month 3: Violations 3 & 4 - Violation 4 = $3,000 MMP
- Month 4: Violation 5 - $3,000 MMP
- Month 5: Violation 6 - $3,000 MMP
**Total:** $9,000 in MMPs

### Example 3: Late DMR
**Situation:** DMR due January 1, submitted April 15
**Calculation:** 104 days late = 3 complete 30-day periods
**Result:** 3 serious violations × $3,000 = $9,000 MMP

## Real-World Case Examples

### City of Lathrop (2024)
- 30 pH effluent violations over ~5 weeks
- Each classified as OEV and CHRON violation
- Total expedited payment: $87,000 (29 violations × $3,000)

### City of Modesto/Turlock (2025)
- 6 chronic violations
- Expedited payment: $18,000

## MMP Statistics (2022)

- 1,067 violations subject to MMPs occurred
- 40% had received some enforcement by November 2023
- 18% fully addressed
- Wastewater Program: ~90 penalty actions (highest of all programs)

## Key Points

1. **Non-Discretionary**: Water Boards MUST assess MMPs when triggered
2. **Cannot Be Reduced**: No discretionary reduction below $3,000
3. **Cumulative**: Multiple violations = multiple MMPs
4. **Exemptions Are Narrow**: Most violations will trigger full MMP
5. **Small Communities Have Options**: Compliance project conversion available
