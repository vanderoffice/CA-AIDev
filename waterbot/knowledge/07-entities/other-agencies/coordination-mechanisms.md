## NEPA/CEQA Interface

### When Both Apply

**Triggers:**
- Federal funding
- Federal permits required
- Federal lands involved

### Coordination Mechanisms

**Joint Documents:**
- Combined EIS/EIR
- Lead agency designation
- Shared analysis

**Tiering:**
- Programmatic to project-level
- Broad to specific
- Reduces redundancy

**Consistency:**
- Mitigation measure alignment
- Impact analysis coordination
- Public comment integration

### California Considerations

**CEQA Often More Stringent:**
- Broader coverage
- Different significance thresholds
- Additional state requirements

**Water Board Role:**
- Responsible agency under NEPA
- Lead or responsible under CEQA
- 401 certification triggers CEQA
- Permits may require CEQA
