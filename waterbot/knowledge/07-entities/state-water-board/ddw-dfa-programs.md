# Drinking Water and Financial Assistance Programs

## Division of Drinking Water Overview

The Division of Drinking Water (DDW) ensures public water systems throughout California provide safe drinking water in compliance with federal and state requirements.

### By the Numbers

- **~8,000** public water systems regulated
- **39+ million** Californians served
- Range from small rural systems (<1,000 people) to major urban utilities

### Key Functions

- Public water system oversight
- Safe Drinking Water Act enforcement
- SAFER program administration
- Water system permitting
- Compliance monitoring and enforcement
- Technical assistance

## SAFER Program

The **Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience (SAFER)** Program is California's signature initiative for ensuring access to safe drinking water in disadvantaged communities.

### Legislative Foundation

**Senate Bill 200** (July 2019)
- Established Safe and Affordable Drinking Water (SADW) Fund
- $1.4 billion over ten years
- Focus on San Joaquin Valley and rural regions
- Addresses 1+ million Californians without reliable safe water

### Program Goals

Ensure that Californians who currently lack safe drinking water receive it **as quickly as possible** through:
- Emergency and urgent funding
- Interim solutions
- Long-term infrastructure investments
- System consolidations
- Technical assistance

### Achievements (2019-2024)

| Consolidations completed | **170** (benefiting 324,101 people) |

### SADW Fund Priority Uses

1. **Emergency/urgent funding** — Critical shortages, outages
2. **Accelerate consolidations** — Out-of-compliance or at-risk systems
3. **State small water systems** — Systems serving <15 connections
4. **Domestic wells** — Private wells in small disadvantaged communities
5. **Interim solutions** — Bottled water, hauled water, point-of-use treatment
6. **Long-term solutions** — Infrastructure, treatment, source development

### Funding Amounts

- Up to **$130 million per year** for 10 years (starting FY 2020-21)
- Covers local assistance and state operations

### Complementary Funding Sources

| Source | Purpose |
|--------|---------|

## 2025 SAFER Needs Assessment

### Risk Assessment Accuracy

- 2025 assessment correctly predicted **92%** of systems on 2024 Failing list
- 19% of at-risk systems received $174 million in funding/technical assistance

### Cost Estimates

**Long-term solutions (Failing + At-Risk systems):**
- Total: **$4.9 billion** (~$1.5B higher than 2021 estimate)
- Disadvantaged communities: **$3.7 billion** (69% of total)
  - Failing DAC systems: $1.75 billion
  - At-Risk DAC systems: $1.97 billion

**Interim solutions:**
- Total: **$466 million** (~$379M lower than 2021—systems moving off Failing list)

**State small water systems + domestic wells:**
- Combined: **~$4.9 billion**

### Affordability Assessment

- **75 systems** (4%) identified with high affordability challenges
- New methodology incorporates additional census data
- Affects DAC/SDAC determinations
