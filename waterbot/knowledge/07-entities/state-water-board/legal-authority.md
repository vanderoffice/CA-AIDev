# State Water Board Legal Authority

## Overview

The State Water Resources Control Board derives its authority from multiple state and federal sources, creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for water quality protection, water rights administration, and drinking water oversight. This authority encompasses both quasi-legislative (rulemaking) and quasi-judicial (adjudicatory) powers.

## Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act

The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, codified in Division 7 of the California Water Code (commencing with Section 13000), is the **primary legal authority** for California water quality regulation.

### Key Provisions

**State Policy Declaration:**
> "The state must be prepared to exercise its full power and jurisdiction to protect the quality of the waters in the state from degradation."

**Scope of Authority:**
- Protects all waters of the state (surface and groundwater)
- Regulates nearly any source of waste discharge
- Includes nonpoint sources exempt from federal permitting
- More comprehensive than federal Clean Water Act

**Regulatory Powers:**
- Establish water quality control plans (basin plans)
- Issue waste discharge requirements
- Set water quality objectives
- Develop implementation programs
- Require monitoring and reporting

**Enforcement Authority:**
- Cease-and-desist orders
- Administrative civil liability orders
- Mandatory minimum penalties
- Cleanup and abatement orders
- Remediation requirements

### Historical Significance

Porter-Cologne was so influential that Congressional authors used sections of it as the basis for the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Clean Water Act). The California law predated and shaped federal water quality legislation.

## California Water Code

The Water Code provides statutory authority across multiple divisions:

### Division 7: Water Quality
- Establishes State and Regional Water Boards
- Defines beneficial uses
- Authorizes basin planning
- Creates enforcement mechanisms

### Water Code Section 175
Establishes the State Water Board composition:
- Five members appointed by Governor
- Senate confirmation required
- Four-year terms
- Specific qualification requirements for each position

### Water Rights Provisions
- Grants sole administrative authority over water rights
- Authorizes permit and license proceedings
- Establishes priority system
- Governs transfers and changes

## Clean Water Act Delegation

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has delegated Clean Water Act authority to California:

### NPDES Program
- **National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System** permitting
- Regulates point source discharges to surface waters
- California issues permits under state/federal standards
- EPA retains oversight and audit authority

### Section 401 Certification
- State certification required for federal permits
- Ensures projects meet state water quality standards
- Applies to Section 404 (wetlands) permits
- Applies to FERC hydropower licenses

### Section 303(d) Listing
- Identify impaired water bodies
- Develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)
- Subject to EPA approval

### State Revolving Funds
EPA delegated administration of:
- **Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF)** — 40 CFR Part 35, Subpart K
- **Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF)** — 40 CFR Part 35, Subpart L

## Safe Drinking Water Act

The State Water Board administers drinking water regulation under federal delegation:

### Delegated Authority
- Establish and enforce drinking water standards
- Oversee approximately 7,500 public water systems
- Maintain primacy over federal program
- Implement both federal and more stringent state standards

### State Implementation
- Division of Drinking Water operates as primacy agency
- ELAP laboratory accreditation program
- Compliance monitoring and enforcement
- Technical assistance programs

### California Additions
- Human Right to Water (AB 685, 2012)
- SAFER program requirements
- State MCLs more stringent than federal for some contaminants

## Enforcement Powers

### Administrative Actions

| Tool | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Cease and Desist Orders** | Stop ongoing violations |
| **Cleanup and Abatement Orders** | Remediate contamination |
| **Administrative Civil Liability** | Monetary penalties |
| **Time Schedule Orders** | Compliance deadlines |
| **Investigative Orders** | Require assessment/monitoring |

### Mandatory Minimum Penalties

Statute requires minimum penalties for:
- Serious violations of waste discharge requirements
- Chronic violators (four or more violations in six months)
- Group I pollutant discharges
- Oil and hazardous substance spills

### Supplemental Environmental Projects

Violators may implement environmental projects in lieu of portions of mandatory minimum penalties, subject to approval.

### Civil and Criminal Referrals

- May refer cases to Attorney General
- Criminal penalties for knowing violations
- Civil penalties up to $10,000/day for some violations
- Additional penalties for false statements

## Regulatory Scope

### What the State Water Board Regulates

**Water Quality:**
- All surface waters (rivers, lakes, streams, bays, ocean)
- All groundwater
- Wetlands and riparian areas
- Storm drains and urban runoff

**Discharges:**
- Municipal wastewater treatment plants
- Industrial facilities
- Stormwater (MS4, industrial, construction)
- Agricultural operations
- Cannabis cultivation
- Oil and gas operations
- Vessel discharges
- Nonpoint source pollution

**Water Rights:**
- Appropriative rights (post-1914)
- Statements of diversion and use
- Water transfers
- Temporary permits
- Changes in place/purpose of use

**Drinking Water:**
- Public water systems
- Private water supplies serving multiple connections
- Bottled water
- Vended water

### Coordination with Other Laws

**CEQA:** State Water Board actions are typically subject to California Environmental Quality Act review

**Endangered Species Act:** Water rights and discharge permits must consider species impacts

**Coastal Act:** Coordination with Coastal Commission on coastal zone permits

**SGMA:** State Water Board has intervention authority for groundwater basins failing to achieve sustainability

## Federal Relationship

### EPA Oversight

California's delegated programs remain subject to:
- EPA review and approval of standards
- Periodic program audits
- Reporting requirements (ICIS-NPDES, SDWIS)
- Potential withdrawal of delegation

### Delegation Conditions

California must maintain:
- Standards at least as stringent as federal
- Adequate enforcement capability
- Public participation opportunities
- Permit and reporting requirements

### Performance Partnership Agreement

Annual agreement with EPA establishes:
- Joint priorities
- Performance measures
- Grant conditions
- Reporting schedules

## Limitation on Authority

The State Water Board cannot:
- Adjudicate pre-1914 or riparian water rights (court jurisdiction)
- Override federal reserved rights
- Permit discharges that violate federal standards
- Act inconsistently with EPA-approved standards without EPA approval
- Exceed constitutional due process requirements
