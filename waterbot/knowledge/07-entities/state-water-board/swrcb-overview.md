# State Water Resources Control Board Overview

## What is the State Water Board?

The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB or State Water Board) is the primary state agency responsible for protecting and managing California's water resources. It exercises comprehensive authority over both water quality and water rights allocation—a distinctive consolidation of functions that enables integrated protection across California's complex hydrological systems.

The State Water Board operates as a quasi-judicial regulatory body with both administrative and adjudicatory functions. It develops statewide permits, policies, and regulations; regulates drinking water systems; administers California's water rights system; and supports the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards that operate at regional scales.

## Creation and History

The institutional framework governing California's water resources developed over more than a century:

**Early History (1900s-1950s)**
- Water rights commission created to manage conflicts arising from the 1849 Gold Rush era
- State Water Rights Board formally established in 1956
- Dickey Water Pollution Control Act (1949) created State Water Pollution Control Board with nine Regional boards

**Critical Consolidation (1967)**
- California Legislature merged the State Water Quality Control Board and State Water Rights Board into a single entity—the State Water Resources Control Board
- This merger integrated water allocation and quality protection under unified authority

**Porter-Cologne Act (1969)**
- Enacted effective January 1, 1970
- Named for Assemblyman Carly V. Porter and Senator Gordon Cologne
- Recognized as one of the nation's strongest anti-pollution laws
- So influential that Congress used sections as the basis for the Clean Water Act (1972)
- Established the modern regulatory framework still in use today

## Mission Statement

The State Water Board's official mission:

> "To preserve, enhance, and restore the quality of California's water resources and drinking water for the protection of the environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and to ensure proper water resource allocation and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations."

This mission integrates multiple objectives: environmental protection, public health, resource efficiency, and equitable allocation of California's finite water supplies.

## Foundational Values

The State Water Board has adopted several foundational values central to its operations:
- **Climate Change Resilience** — Adapting water management to changing conditions
- **Environmental Justice** — Ensuring equitable access and participation
- **Racial Equity** — Addressing disproportionate burdens on communities
- **Human Right to Water** — California law declares every person has the right to safe, clean, affordable water

## Relationship to CalEPA

The State Water Board operates as a constituent agency within the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA). CalEPA oversees six major environmental entities:

1. California Air Resources Board (CARB)
2. Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR)
3. Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)
4. Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)
5. Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA)
6. **State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB)**

While positioned within CalEPA, the State Water Board exercises substantial regulatory independence under water-specific statutes.

## Board Membership Structure
