# Division of Water Quality Programs

## Overview

The Division of Water Quality (DWQ) implements the State Water Board's most visible regulatory programs, addressing water pollution from both point and nonpoint sources. Programs operate under dual authority: federal Clean Water Act provisions and California's Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.

## NPDES Permitting Program

The **National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)** program is the federal regulatory backbone for controlling point source discharges to waters of the United States.

### How NPDES Works

- Permits issued by State Water Board and Regional Boards
- Establishes discharge limits, monitoring requirements, and compliance schedules
- Two permit types:
  - **Individual permits** — Tailored to specific facilities
  - **General permits** — Cover categories of similar dischargers

### Database Access

- **CIWQS** (California Integrated Water Quality System) provides public access
- **Facility at-a-Glance Report** — Owner info, violations, inspections, orders
- **Interactive Regulated Facilities Report** — Filter by city, county, region, program

### Permit Identification

- State permits: "DWQ" designation (e.g., 2014-0057-DWQ)
- Regional permits: R1-R9 designation (e.g., R4-2021-0105)

## Stormwater Programs

### Municipal Stormwater (MS4) Permits

**Phase I MS4** — Larger municipalities
- Covers urban areas with populations over 100,000
- Region-specific permits issued by each Regional Board
- Examples:
  - SF Bay: Municipal Regional Stormwater Permit (MRP)
  - Los Angeles: Regional Phase I MS4 NPDES Permit
  - San Diego: Region-wide MS4 Permit

**Phase II Small MS4** — Smaller municipalities
- General Permit: Water Quality Order 2013-0001-DWQ
- Six amendments since adoption
- Covers smaller urban areas
- Requires Low Impact Development (LID) BMPs

**LID Sizing Tools:**
- Phase II LID Sizing Tool — Projects ≥5,000 sq ft impervious
- Small Project Site Design Calculator — Projects 2,500-5,000 sq ft

### Industrial Stormwater General Permit

**Order 2014-0057-DWQ** (amended 2015, 2018)

Regulates nine federally defined industrial categories:
1. Manufacturers
2. Landfills
3. Mining operations
4. Steam-generating power plants
5. Hazardous waste facilities
6. Transportation/vehicle maintenance
7. Large wastewater plants
8. Recycling facilities
9. Oil and gas operations

**Requirements:**
- Register through SMARTS (online permitting system)
- Develop Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)
- Implement Best Management Practices (BMPs)
- Conduct stormwater sampling
- Report through SMARTS

**TMDL Requirements:**
- Enhanced requirements for discharges to impaired waters
- GIS mapping tool identifies applicable TMDLs by location

**Status:** Expired June 30, 2020; continues on administrative extension pending reissuance.

### Construction Stormwater General Permit

**Order 2009-0009-DWQ** (as amended)

**Risk-Based Approach:**

| Risk Level | Requirements |
|------------|--------------|
| Level 1 | Basic erosion/sediment control |
| Level 2 | Enhanced BMPs, more monitoring |
| Level 3 | Most stringent controls |

**Risk Factors:**
- Project size and duration
- Site characteristics (slope, soil type)
- Proximity to sensitive waterbodies
- In-channel construction activities

**Requirements:**
- Prepare risk assessment worksheet
- Qualified SWPPP Practitioner (QSP) review for complex projects
- Post-construction water balance standards for new impervious surface
- Electronic calculators via SMARTS

## Section 401 Water Quality Certification

Clean Water Act Section 401 requires state certification that federal permit activities will comply with state water quality standards.

### Jurisdiction

| Project Type | Administering Division |
|--------------|----------------------|
| FERC hydropower licenses | Division of Water Rights |
| Water right appropriations | Division of Water Rights |
| Multi-region projects (non-water rights) | Division of Water Quality |

### Application Process

1. **Pre-filing meeting** — Required 30 days before application
2. **Application submission** — Staff review within 30 days
3. **Completeness determination** — Additional info if needed
4. **Public notice** — Minimum 21 days before action
5. **Certification decision** — Certify, condition, or deny

### General Orders

Streamlined coverage for low-impact activities:
- Army Corps regional general permits
- Certain Nationwide Permits
- Habitat restoration activities
- Applicants submit Notice of Intent (NOI) instead of full application

## Nonpoint Source Program

Addresses pollution from diffuse sources (not discharged from pipes):
- Agricultural runoff
- Urban development
- Livestock operations
- Forestry activities

### Program Elements

- Grant funding for NPS pollution control projects
- Coordination with Regional Boards
- 319(h) grant administration (Clean Water Act funding)
- TMDL implementation support

**Annual solicitation** for project proposals available through State Water Board website.

## Underground Storage Tank Program

Protects groundwater from petroleum and hazardous substance releases.

### Four Primary Elements

1. **Leak Prevention** — Proper design, installation, operation
2. **Tank Tester Licensing** — Certified testing professionals
3. **Cleanup Programs** — Petroleum release remediation
4. **Enforcement** — Compliance assurance

### Major Milestone: Single-Wall Tank Closure

**As of January 1, 2026**, single-walled underground storage tanks are **no longer permitted to operate** in California.

- 99% of single-walled tanks closed by January 2026
- Major achievement in groundwater contamination prevention

### Key Resources

- **GeoTracker** — Electronic tracking system for cleanup sites
- Low-threat closure policy guidance
- Well destruction procedures
- Cleanup fund information

## Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP)

Initiated 2003, expanded 2012. Addresses agricultural runoff impacts on surface and groundwater quality.
