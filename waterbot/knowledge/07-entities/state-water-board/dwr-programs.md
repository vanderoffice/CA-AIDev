# Division of Water Rights Programs

## Overview

The Division of Water Rights administers California's complex water rights system, which allocates water for beneficial uses while protecting existing rights and environmental flows. The division manages the permitting process for post-1914 appropriative rights and maintains comprehensive databases tracking water use throughout the state.

## California Water Rights Foundation

### Types of Water Rights

**Riparian Rights**
- Attach to land adjacent to water sources
- No permit required
- Correlative (shared) during shortages
- Cannot store water for dry season use
- Limited to land within watershed
- Terminate if property severed from water source

**Pre-1914 Appropriative Rights**
- Established before Water Commission Act of 1914
- No state permit required
- Priority based on date of first use
- Self-reported through Statements of Diversion and Use

**Post-1914 Appropriative Rights**
- Require State Water Board permit
- Priority based on application date
- Subject to permit terms and conditions
- Most common type administered by Division

**Groundwater Rights**
- Historically minimal state regulation
- SGMA (2014) established sustainability framework
- Subject to adjudication in some basins

## Water Rights Application Process

### Step 1: Application Filing

Submit application describing:
- Water source
- Point(s) of diversion
- Place of use
- Purpose (beneficial use)
- Quantity requested

**Board response:** Accept or request additional information within 30 days
**Priority date:** Established upon application acceptance

### Step 2: Water Availability Analysis (WAA)

Applicant must demonstrate:
- Unappropriated water is available
- Appropriation serves public interest
- Will not injure existing water rights
- Protects instream ecosystem functions

**WAA Methodologies:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Site-specific analysis | Detailed hydrologic study |
| Regional criteria | Pre-approved regional standards |
| Streamlined approaches | For high-flow diversions |

### Streamlined 90th Percentile Method

For applicants diverting during high flows:
- Divert only when flows exceed 90th percentile daily flow
- Cap diversions at 20% of daily flow
- Protects critical ecosystem functions
- Assumes flows above 90th percentile (Dec-Mar) are protective

**Requirements:**
- Install telemetered gage near diversion point
- Use flow gage with 30+ years of record
- Prorate statistics when direct gage data unavailable

### Delta Watershed WAA Tool

Specialized tool for Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta projects:
- Operated by Division staff
- Tailored to Delta's complex hydrology
- Incorporates climate scenario analysis
- Accounts for regulatory and operational factors

### Step 3: Permit Issuance

Permit specifies:
- Water quantity authorized
- Beneficial uses permitted
- Point(s) of diversion
- Place of use
- Construction timeline
- Conditions for beneficial use

**Construction deadline:** Begin within 2 years (extensions possible)

### Step 4: License Issuance

After permit is fully developed:
- All conditions met
- Maximum beneficial use achieved
- Board conducts licensing proceeding
- License confirms final appropriative right

License remains effective as long as:
- Conditions are met
- Beneficial use continues

## Key Databases and Systems

### CalWATRS (California Water Accounting, Tracking, and Reporting System)

**Launched:** July 2025 (replaced eWRIMS)

**Features:**
- View all water right records
- File annual reports
- Request water rights services
- Web-based forms (October 2025)
- Organization accounts for agencies/businesses

**Access:**
- PIN mailed to owners/agents (Oct-Nov 2025)
- Create unique username/password
- eWRIMS credentials do not transfer

### eWRIMS (Legacy System)

- Data no longer updated as of June 9, 2025
- Historical data still accessible
- Replaced by CalWATRS

### Reporting Requirements

**Ownership changes:** Notify within 30 days
- Violation penalty: Up to $500/day

**Annual reports:** Required for all water rights
- Statements of Water Diversion and Use

## Water Transfers

Allows temporary or permanent changes to water rights:
- Place of use
- Point of diversion
- Beneficial use

### Streamlined Transfer Process (2026)

**Effective January 31, 2026:** Reduced processing time from 65 to 55 days

**Eligibility requirements:**
- Notify Division by January 31, 2026
- Provide permit/license number
- Specify method water made available
- Provide contact email

**Methods water made available:**
- Crop idling/shifting
- Groundwater substitution
- Reservoir release
- Conservation

## Groundwater Programs

### SGMA Support

The Division supports Sustainable Groundwater Management Act implementation:
- Technical assistance to GSAs
- Groundwater sustainability plan review
- State intervention authority
- Probationary basin management

### Groundwater Adjudication

Resolves competing groundwater claims:
- Defines conflicts and claims
- Determines sustainable yield
- Distributes rights by quantity
- Assigns priorities during shortage

**Process:**
- State Water Board initiates based on petition
- Board makes initial determination
- Court issues final decree
- Board can set limits and curtail use

## Bay-Delta Water Rights

The Division has primary responsibility for protecting the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

### Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan

Establishes:
- Water quality control measures
- Flow requirements for beneficial uses
- Fish and wildlife protection
- Agricultural water quality objectives

### Recent Updates

**December 2018:** Adopted amendments for:
- Lower San Joaquin River flows
- Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced tributaries
- Southern Delta salinity objectives

**December 2025:** Released revised draft Sacramento/Delta updates:
- Sacramento River and tributaries
- Delta eastside tributaries
- Interior Delta flows
- Delta outflows
- Voluntary agreement protocols

**Public Hearing:** January 28-30, 2026

## Drought Response and Curtailment Authority

### Emergency Curtailment Powers

The Board can curtail water rights when water is unavailable at a given priority level.

**August 2021:** Initial curtailment orders issued for Delta watershed
- Unprecedented drought conditions
- Protected water supplies, environmental flows, ecosystem health

**Process:**
- Emergency regulations adopted
- Methodology for water unavailability determination
- Curtailment status list published
- Reporting requirements imposed

**April 2023:** All curtailment orders rescinded
- Improved water supply conditions
- Board continues monitoring
- Can reinstitute if conditions deteriorate

### Curtailment Compliance

Water right holders must:
- Monitor Delta Watershed Curtailment Status List
- Cease diversions when curtailed
- Report diversions

### Violation Penalties

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Unauthorized diversion | $1,000/day + $2,500/acre-foot |
| Attorney General referral | Significantly higher court penalties |

## Water Availability Monitoring

### Real-Time Data

- Telemetry pilot projects (Russian River)
- Enhanced monitoring networks
- Water availability assessments

### Watershed Assessments

- Supply and demand analysis
- Support water allocation decisions
- Drought response planning
- Curtailment prioritization

## Permit Types by Category
