### California Implementation

**How California Meets CWA:**

| CWA Requirement | California Implementation |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| NPDES permits | State/Regional Board permits |
| Effluent guidelines | Incorporated in permits |
| Water quality standards | Basin Plans + statewide plans |
| TMDLs | Basin Plan amendments |
| 305(b) reporting | Integrated Report |
| 303(d) listing | Integrated Report |
| Monitoring | SWAMP, CEDEN, facility DMRs |

## Safe Drinking Water Act Requirements

### Public Water System Regulation

**SDWA Primacy:**
- California has SDWA primacy (delegation)
- Division of Drinking Water administers
- EPA oversight and approval authority

**Primary Standards (MCLs):**
- Enforceable maximum contaminant levels
- California may adopt more stringent
- State MCLs for some contaminants (e.g., hexavalent chromium)

**Secondary Standards:**
- Non-enforceable guidelines
- Aesthetic concerns (taste, odor, color)

### California-Specific Standards

**More Stringent State Standards:**

| Contaminant | Federal MCL | California MCL |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Hexavalent chromium | None | 10 ppb (pending) |
| Perchlorate | None | 6 ppb |
| 1,2,3-TCP | None | 5 ppt |

### Compliance and Enforcement

**State Responsibilities:**
- Issue permits to public water systems
- Conduct sanitary surveys
- Review monitoring data
- Take enforcement action
- Report to EPA (SDWIS data)

**Federal Oversight:**
- Review state program implementation
- Approve program modifications
- Provide technical assistance
- Take enforcement if needed

## Reporting Requirements

### ICIS-NPDES (Integrated Compliance Information System)

**Data Submission:**
- Permit information
- Limits and monitoring requirements
- Discharge monitoring reports (DMRs)
- Compliance status
- Enforcement actions

**California Data Flow:**
- Facilities submit DMRs through CIWQS
- CIWQS data transferred to ICIS-NPDES
- EPA uses for national reporting and analysis

### SDWIS (Safe Drinking Water Information System)

**Required Data:**
- Water system inventory
- Violations
- Enforcement actions
- Monitoring results
- Variance and exemption tracking

### Annual Reporting

**305(b) Water Quality Report:**
- Assessment of all waters
- Attainment of designated uses
- Pollution sources
- Progress in restoration

**303(d) Impaired Waters List:**
- Waters not meeting standards
- Prioritized for TMDL development
- Submitted with 305(b) as Integrated Report

**Grant Performance Reports:**
- Workplan progress
- Expenditure tracking
- Deliverable completion
- Performance measures

## Grant Requirements

### State Revolving Fund (SRF) Programs

**Clean Water SRF (CWSRF):**
- Federal capitalization grants to states
- State provides 20% match
- Loans for wastewater, stormwater, NPS
- Must maintain perpetual fund

**Drinking Water SRF (DWSRF):**
- Federal capitalization grants
- State provides 20% match
- Loans for drinking water infrastructure
- Set-asides for small systems, source protection

**SRF Conditions:**

| Requirement | CWSRF | DWSRF |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| State match | 20% | 20% |
| Disadvantaged community set-aside | Variable | 6-35% |
| American Iron & Steel | Yes | Yes |
| Davis-Bacon wages | Yes | Yes |
| NEPA-equivalent review | Yes | Yes |

### Section 106 Grants

**Purpose:** Support state water pollution control programs

**Eligible Activities:**
- Permit program administration
- Water quality standards development
- Monitoring and assessment
- Enforcement
- Data management

**Match Requirement:** None for base grant, varies for additional funding

### Section 319 Grants

**Purpose:** Nonpoint source pollution control

**Eligible Activities:**
- NPS program implementation
- Watershed projects
- Technical assistance
- Education and outreach
- Monitoring

**Match Requirement:** 40% non-federal match

## Emerging Requirements

### PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)

**EPA PFAS Strategic Roadmap (2021-2024):**

**Final Drinking Water Standards (2024):**
- PFOA: 4 ppt
- PFOS: 4 ppt
- PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA: Individual MCLs
- Hazard Index for mixtures

**NPDES Requirements:**
- EPA developing effluent guidelines
- Multi-industry monitoring
- State permits increasingly include PFAS
- California proposing statewide requirements

**California Response:**
- DDW investigating state drinking water standards
- Regional Boards adding PFAS to permits
- PFAS investigation orders issued
- Monitoring requirements expanding

### Nutrient Criteria

**EPA Guidance:**
- Encourages numeric nutrient criteria
- Regional nutrient criteria documents
- Permit writers' manual

**California Approach:**
- Site-specific numeric endpoints
- Biostimulatory substances policy
- SF Bay nutrient watershed permit
- Salinity/nutrient TMDLs

### Water Reuse

**EPA Water Reuse Action Plan:**
- Support for potable and non-potable reuse
- Research priorities
- Regulatory framework development

**California Leadership:**
- Title 22 regulations (most advanced in nation)
- Direct potable reuse regulations in development
- State Water Board Resolution 2023-0006
- Regional recycled water permits

## Environmental Review Interface

### NEPA/CEQA Coordination

**When Both Apply:**
- Projects with federal funding
- Projects requiring federal permits
- Federal lands

**Coordination Mechanisms:**
- Joint environmental documents
- Lead/responsible agency designation
- Tiering from programmatic to project-level
- Mitigation measure consistency

**California-Specific:**
- CEQA often more stringent
- State agencies as responsible agencies under NEPA
- Water Board permits may trigger CEQA
- 401 certifications may involve NEPA
