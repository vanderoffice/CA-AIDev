# EPA Region 9 Delegation to California

## Clean Water Act Delegation Framework

### NPDES Program Delegation

**Original Authorization:** 1973 - California was among the first states to receive NPDES delegation

**Delegated Authority:**
- Issue individual NPDES permits for point source discharges
- Issue general permits for categories of dischargers
- Modify, suspend, and revoke permits
- Enforce permit requirements
- Collect and maintain discharge monitoring data

**State Implementation:**
- State Water Board issues statewide general permits
- Regional Boards issue individual permits and regional general permits
- Both track permits in CIWQS (California Integrated Water Quality System)
- Data reported to EPA's ICIS-NPDES database

### Section 401 Certification Authority

**Certification Requirement:**
- Any federal license/permit requiring discharge to waters of the U.S.
- State must certify compliance with water quality standards
- No federal permit can be issued without state certification or waiver

**California Implementation:**
- Regional Water Boards issue most 401 certifications
- State Board handles appeals and statewide projects
- 2020 EPA rule changes affected certification scope
- 2023 rule restored broader certification authority

**Key Applications:**
- Army Corps Section 404 permits (dredge and fill)
- FERC hydropower licenses
- Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses
- Rivers and Harbors Act permits

### Section 404 Permit Relationship

**Current Structure (Three-Agency System):**

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| Army Corps of Engineers | Issues 404 permits for dredge and fill |
| EPA | Defines waters of the U.S., can veto permits |
| State Water Board | Issues 401 certification |

**State Assumption Process:**
- CWA Section 404(g) allows state assumption
- California has explored but not pursued full assumption
- Requires EPA-approved program
- Would transfer permitting from Corps to State
- Complex for navigable waters (retained by Corps)

**Current Coordination:**
- Joint pre-application meetings
- Coordinated permit processing timelines
- Consolidated permit applications where possible
- Annual coordination meetings

## Performance Partnership Agreements

### PPA Framework

**Purpose:** Negotiate priorities and performance measures between EPA and State

**Agreement Cycle:** Typically 2-year terms

**Components:**
- Mutually agreed environmental priorities
- Performance measures and targets
- Grant work plans and deliverables
- Flexibility provisions

### California-EPA Region 9 PPA Elements

**Core Commitments:**
- NPDES permit issuance and renewal timelines
- Inspection and enforcement coverage
- Water quality standards triennial reviews
- TMDL development schedules
- Grant fund expenditure rates

**Flexibility Provisions:**
- State may shift resources between programs
- Alternative performance measures allowed
- Innovation pilot programs enabled

## EPA Oversight Authority

### Routine Oversight

**Program Reviews:**
- Periodic permit quality reviews
- Inspection and enforcement audits
- Data quality assessments
- Financial audits of grant expenditures

**Reporting Requirements:**
- Permit Compliance System (PCS) / ICIS-NPDES data
- Annual performance reports
- Grant progress reports
- Water quality assessment reports (305(b))

### Enhanced Oversight Triggers

**Conditions Prompting Increased EPA Involvement:**
- Significant permit backlog
- Pattern of inadequate enforcement
- Failure to meet grant conditions
- Water quality standards disapproval
- State request for assistance

**EPA Response Options:**
- Technical assistance
- Joint enforcement actions
- Concurrent enforcement authority
- Grant conditions or withholding

### Delegation Withdrawal

**Statutory Authority:** CWA Section 402(c)(3)

**Grounds for Withdrawal:**
- State no longer meets program requirements
- State fails to adequately implement program
- Significant deficiencies not corrected

**Process:**
1. EPA identifies deficiencies
2. Notice to State with opportunity to correct
3. Public notice and comment period
4. EPA Administrator decision
5. Federal assumption if withdrawn

**Historical Context:**
- No state has had full NPDES delegation withdrawn
- Partial withdrawals have occurred (specific categories)
- California has maintained continuous delegation since 1973

## Memorandum of Understanding

### Enforcement Coordination MOU

**Purpose:** Define roles in enforcement actions

**Key Provisions:**
- Lead agency designation for cases
- Notification requirements
- Joint enforcement criteria
- Penalty policy coordination
- Criminal referral procedures

**Escalation Pathway:**
1. State takes initial enforcement
2. EPA monitors state actions
3. EPA may take independent action if:
   - State requests assistance
   - Violations present imminent hazard
   - State action inadequate
   - Multi-state violations

### Information Sharing

**Data Systems:**
- CIWQS (California) ↔ ICIS-NPDES (EPA)
- Routine data exchange protocols
- Joint access to violation tracking
- Coordinated inspection planning
