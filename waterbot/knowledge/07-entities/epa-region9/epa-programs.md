# EPA-California Joint Programs

## Water Quality Standards

### Standards Approval Process

**State Role:**
- Adopt water quality standards through Basin Plans
- Conduct triennial reviews (CWA Section 303(c))
- Propose new or revised standards
- Provide public participation opportunities

**EPA Review Process:**

| Step | Timeline | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| State submission | - | Standards package to EPA |
| EPA review | 60 days | Completeness check |
| EPA decision | 90 days | Approve, disapprove, or partial |
| State response | If disapproved | Revise and resubmit |
| Federal promulgation | If needed | EPA issues standards |

**Review Criteria:**
- Protects designated uses
- Based on sound science
- Complies with CWA requirements
- Antidegradation policy implemented
- Implementation procedures adequate

### Recent Standards Actions

**California Human Health Criteria:**
- EPA approved updated human health criteria (2017)
- Based on California-specific fish consumption rates
- More stringent than national recommendations

**Nutrients:**
- EPA has encouraged numeric nutrient criteria
- California developing site-specific approaches
- SF Bay nutrient permit reflects collaboration

**Bacteria:**
- California adopted EPA's 2012 recreational criteria
- Implemented through statewide bacteria objectives

## TMDL Program Oversight

### TMDL Development Process

**Impaired Waters (303(d)) List:**
- State assesses water quality every 2 years
- Identifies waters not meeting standards
- Prioritizes TMDL development schedule
- Submits list to EPA for approval

**EPA Review of 303(d) List:**
- Evaluates listing methodology
- Reviews data supporting listings
- Approves, partially approves, or disapproves
- Can add waters EPA determines are impaired

**TMDL Approval:**
- State submits adopted TMDLs
- EPA reviews within 30 days
- Approves or disapproves
- Disapproval requires EPA to establish TMDL

### California TMDL Status

**Scope:**
- 500+ TMDLs established
- Covers rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters
- Major pollutants: bacteria, nutrients, sediment, metals, pesticides

**Notable TMDLs:**
- San Francisco Bay mercury and PCBs
- Los Angeles area bacteria (multiple)
- Lake Tahoe sediment/nutrients (joint with Nevada)
- Central Valley selenium

### TMDL Implementation

**Regulatory Implementation:**
- NPDES permit limits incorporate wasteload allocations
- Nonpoint source controls through Basin Plan amendments
- Agricultural orders implement load allocations
- MS4 permits include TMDL-based requirements

**Progress Tracking:**
- State reports implementation progress
- EPA monitors achievement of load reductions
- Water quality monitoring verifies improvements

## Enforcement Coordination

### Joint Enforcement Framework

**Lead Agency Determination:**

| Situation | Lead Agency |
|-----------|-------------|
| Routine violations | State |
| Multi-state discharge | EPA |
| Federal facilities | EPA (can delegate) |
| Criminal matters | Joint referral |
| Imminent hazard | Either can act |

**State Enforcement Actions:**
- Notices of Violation
- Cleanup and Abatement Orders
- Cease and Desist Orders
- Administrative Civil Liability
- Water Code Section 13350 penalties

**EPA Enforcement Actions:**
- Administrative compliance orders
- Administrative penalty orders
- Civil judicial referrals
- Criminal referrals (knowing violations)

### Significant Noncompliance (SNC)

**Definition Criteria:**
- Effluent violations ≥2x permit limits
- Chronic violations (≥4 exceedances in 6 months)
- Violation of compliance schedule milestones
- Failure to report
- Other criteria per EPA guidance

**Response Requirements:**
- State must address SNC facilities
- EPA tracks state response
- Escalation if state action inadequate

### Referrals and Overfiling

**State Referral to EPA:**
- Criminal conduct suspected
- Multi-jurisdictional violations
- Resources beyond state capacity
- Federal facilities

**EPA Overfiling:**
- Independent EPA enforcement action
- Used when state action insufficient
- Requires notification to state
- Historically rare in California

## Superfund Coordination

### Site Identification and Assessment

**EPA Role:**
- National Priorities List (NPL) sites
- Preliminary assessments
- Site inspections
- Hazard ranking

**State Role:**
- State Superfund equivalent sites
- Coordinate on federal/state overlap
- Provide local expertise
- Support community engagement

### California Coordination

**Regional Board Involvement:**
- Issue cleanup orders for state-lead sites
- Participate in EPA-lead site teams
- Review proposed remedies
- Issue NPDES permits for discharge from remediation

**Key Joint Sites:**
- Stringfellow Acid Pits
- Operating Industries Inc.
- McCormick & Baxter
- Numerous military installations

## Voluntary Programs

### WaterSense Program

**Purpose:** EPA partnership program for water efficiency

**California Participation:**
- State agencies promote WaterSense products
- Regional programs incorporate specifications
- Rebate programs reference certification

### National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Innovation

**Multi-Sector General Permit:**
- EPA-issued for federal facilities
- Coordinated with state permits
- California has equivalent state program

### Environmental Justice Initiatives

**EPA EJ Programs:**
- EJScreen mapping tool
- Community engagement requirements
- Environmental justice collaborative problem-solving grants

**California Integration:**
- CalEnviroScreen alignment with EJScreen
- EJ considerations in permitting
- Community engagement requirements in permits
- DAC (Disadvantaged Community) identification

## Climate Adaptation Coordination

### Joint Climate Efforts

**Areas of Coordination:**
- Sea level rise impacts on water infrastructure
- Drought planning and response
- Extreme weather resilience
- Water supply reliability

**Relevant Programs:**
- Climate Ready Water Utilities (EPA)
- Safeguarding California Plan (State)
