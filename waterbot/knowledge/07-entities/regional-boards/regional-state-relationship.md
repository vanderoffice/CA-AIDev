# Regional and State Water Board Relationship

## Overview

The California water boards operate through a **hierarchical two-tier system**:
- **State Water Resources Control Board** — Statewide oversight and policy
- **Nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards** — Primary implementation

This structure balances statewide consistency with regional flexibility.

## State Board Oversight Authority

### Guidance and Supervision

The State Water Board provides:
- Overall guidance to Regional Boards
- Review of Regional Board decisions
- Statewide policy direction
- Technical assistance and training
- Consistency across regions

### What State Board Reviews

| Item | State Board Role |
|------|------------------|
| Basin Plans | Must approve before effective |
| Basin Plan Amendments | Review and approve or remand |
| Petitions | Hear appeals of Regional Board decisions |
| Policies | Adopt statewide standards |
| General Orders | Issue statewide permits |

### Precedential Decisions

State Board decisions and orders are **precedential** unless:
- Specifically designated as non-precedential
- Superseded by later statutes, judicial opinions, or subsequent State Board actions

Regional Boards **must follow** State Board precedent when deciding comparable cases.

The State Board may refine, reformulate, or reverse precedents but must:
- Confront any inconsistent precedent
- Explain reasons for the change

## Appeal Process: Petitions for Review

### Filing a Petition

Any person aggrieved by a Regional Board decision may petition the State Board:

**Deadline:** 30 days from issuance of order/decision
- If 30th day is Saturday, Sunday, or state holiday → due next business day by 5:00 p.m.
- Date of issuance = date order is signed

**Delivery Methods:**
- In person
- Mail
- Fax
- Email (preferred in addition to other methods)

### Petition Requirements

A petition must include:
1. Petitioner's name and address
2. Copy of the order/decision under review
3. Reasons the order was inappropriate or improper
4. Specific action requested from State Board
5. Statement of points and authorities (legal issues)
6. Phone number and email if available

### State Board Options

After receiving a petition, the State Board may:
- **Refuse** — If petition fails to raise substantial issues
- **Deny** — If Regional Board action was appropriate
- **Set aside or modify** — The Regional Board's order
- **Take other appropriate action**

### Important Notes

**No automatic stay:** Filing a petition does NOT automatically stay the Regional Board's order
- Petitioner must continue complying during review
- May request a stay (must be granted by State Board after notice/hearing)

**Most petitions resolved without hearing** — State Board has discretion to determine if evidentiary hearing is necessary

### Current Petitions

The State Board maintains a public list of active petitions for review at:
waterboards.ca.gov/public_notices/petitions/water_quality/

## Statewide vs. Regional Permits

### Statewide Permits (State Board Issues)

The State Board adopts **statewide general orders** for:
- Issues affecting multiple regions
- Categories of dischargers best regulated consistently
- Emerging challenges requiring unified approach

**Examples:**
- Industrial General Permit (stormwater)
- Construction General Permit
- Phase II Small MS4 Permit
- Cannabis Cultivation General Order
- Statewide WDR for recycled water

### Regional Permits (Regional Boards Issue)

Regional Boards issue permits for:
- Individual facilities in their jurisdiction
- Regional general permits
- Site-specific waste discharge requirements
- NPDES permits for local dischargers

### Coordination

- Statewide permits set minimum standards
- Regional Boards may impose additional requirements
- Regional Boards enforce statewide permits within their jurisdictions

## Policy Consistency Requirements

### State Board Policies

Regional Boards must implement:
- State Board resolutions
- Statewide plans and policies
- Precedential decisions
- Regulatory requirements

### Basin Plan Approval

Regional Board basin plans require:

| Approval Level | Entity |
|----------------|--------|
| 1. Adoption | Regional Board |
| 2. Approval | State Water Board |
| 3. Review | Office of Administrative Law |
| 4. Approval (surface water standards) | US EPA |

### Amendment Process

Basin plan amendments follow similar multi-level approval:
1. Regional Board public hearing and adoption
2. State Board review and approval (or remand)
3. OAL verification of rulemaking process
4. EPA approval if surface water standards involved

## Funding Flow

### State Board Allocates to Regional Boards

The State Board:
- Allocates operational funding to Regional Boards
- Distributes federal grant funds
- Manages financial assistance programs
- Supports regional capacity building

### Funding Sources

- State General Fund appropriations

### Financial Assistance Administration

The State Board's Division of Financial Assistance administers:
- Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF)

Regional Boards may refer applicants to these programs but don't administer them directly.

## Staff Relationships

### Organizational Structure

- State Board staff work from Sacramento headquarters
- Regional Board staff work from regional offices
- Executive Officers report to their Regional Boards

## Joint Enforcement Actions

### When Joint Enforcement Occurs

The State Board may take enforcement in lieu of Regional Board:
- Multi-regional facilities or permittees
- Statewide general permit violations
- Petitions alleging Regional Board inaction
- Cases requiring statewide coordination

### Enforcement Coordination

- State Board Office of Enforcement coordinates statewide initiatives
- Regional Enforcement Coordinators appointed at each Regional Board
- Cross-regional communication on priority violators
- Joint inspections for complex facilities

## Summary: Division of Responsibilities

| Function | Primary Authority |
|----------|------------------|
| **Basin Planning** | Regional Board (State Board approval) |
| **Individual Permits** | Regional Board |
| **Statewide Permits** | State Board |
| **Enforcement** | Regional Board (State Board oversight) |
| **Appeals** | State Board |
| **Policy Setting** | State Board |
| **Policy Implementation** | Regional Board |
| **Funding Allocation** | State Board |
| **Financial Assistance** | State Board (Division of Financial Assistance) |
| **Water Rights** | State Board (Division of Water Rights) |
| **Drinking Water** | State Board (Division of Drinking Water) |

## Key Principle

> Regional Boards have **primary responsibility** for water quality within their jurisdictions, exercising broad authority to protect beneficial uses. The State Board provides **oversight and consistency** while respecting regional expertise and conditions.

This structure ensures that:
- Local conditions are considered in permitting
- Statewide standards maintain consistency
- Appeals mechanism provides accountability
- Resources are efficiently allocated
