# Regional Water Quality Control Boards Overview

## The Nine-Region System

California's water quality governance relies on a two-tiered regulatory structure: one State Water Resources Control Board and **nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs)**. This structure was established by the Dickey Water Pollution Act (1949) and modernized by the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (1969).

### Why Nine Regions?

The Regional Boards are organized along **hydrological and watershed boundaries** rather than political jurisdictions (county lines). This watershed-based approach reflects the fundamental reality that:

- Water moves through natural drainage patterns
- Water quality management is most effective when authority aligns with natural basins
- Different regions have significantly different climates, topography, geology, and hydrology

### Collective Jurisdiction

The nine Regional Boards together govern:
- **1.6 million acres** of lakes
- **1.3 million acres** of bays and estuaries
- **211,000 miles** of rivers and streams
- **~1,100 miles** of California coastline
- All groundwater resources

## Regional Board Authority

### Primary Responsibilities

Each Regional Board has **primary responsibility** for water quality matters within its region:

1. **Basin Planning** — Develop Water Quality Control Plans (basin plans) designating beneficial uses and water quality objectives
2. **Permitting** — Issue NPDES permits and Waste Discharge Requirements
3. **Enforcement** — Take action against violations
4. **Monitoring** — Assess water quality conditions
5. **Protection** — Preserve and enhance beneficial uses

### Legal Foundation

Regional Boards operate under authority from:
- **Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act** — State law providing comprehensive water quality authority
- **Clean Water Act** — Federal law delegated to California for NPDES permits
- **Basin Plans** — Regional standards and objectives

### Regulatory Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **NPDES Permits** | Regulate point source discharges to surface waters |
| **Waste Discharge Requirements** | Regulate discharges to land/groundwater |
| **Cleanup and Abatement Orders** | Require contamination remediation |
| **Cease and Desist Orders** | Stop ongoing violations |
| **Administrative Civil Liability** | Monetary penalties for violations |
| **Investigative Orders** | Require information about potential discharges |

## Board Membership Structure

### Composition

Each Regional Board consists of **seven part-time members**:
- Appointed by the Governor
- Confirmed by the California Senate
- Four-year terms
- Must reside or work within the region

### Qualification Requirements

Members must demonstrate:
- Interest or proven ability in water quality
- Experience in water pollution control, resource management, water use, or water protection

At least one member must be a **public member** (no specialized water quality expertise required).

### Encouraged Diversity

Governor encouraged to appoint members from:
- Agriculture
- Industry
- Commercial activities
- Forestry
- Fisheries
- Different parts of the region (geographic diversity)

### Compensation

Regional Board members serve on a **volunteer or per diem basis**:
- $250 per diem compensation
- Typically 1-2 day-long meetings monthly
- Significant time commitment despite minimal pay

### Conflict of Interest Rules

Members cannot receive ≥10% of household income from any person or entity:
- Subject to waste discharge requirements
- Applying for such requirements

Exception: Retirement/pension income (≥60 years old) allows up to 50% threshold

## Executive Officer Role

Each Regional Board has an **Executive Officer** serving as the principal administrative head.

### Executive Officer Responsibilities

- Advise board on policy matters
- Implement board policies and direction
- Direct regional board staff
- Develop solutions to complex water quality challenges
- Oversee basin plan development
- Process waste discharge permits
- Oversee site remediation
- Conduct enforcement activities
- Serve as primary public interface

### Delegated Authority

Executive Officers may exercise delegated authority to:
- Issue cleanup and abatement orders
- Issue investigative orders
- Make certain staff-level decisions

**Note:** Final formal actions must be taken by the full board at duly called meetings with a majority present.

### Staff Structure

Regional Board staff typically includes:
- Environmental engineers
- Environmental scientists
- Attorneys
- Administrative personnel

Staff size varies by region (30-350+ depending on workload and jurisdiction size).

## Regional Board Meetings

### Meeting Schedule

- Typically monthly or bi-monthly
- One or two days per meeting

- Receive staff reports
- Take public comment

### Public Participation

- Public comment periods for all items
- Workshop sessions for major issues
- Written comment opportunities

## Relationship to State Water Board

### State Board Oversight

The State Water Board:
- Provides guidance and supervision
- Reviews Regional Board decisions
- Allocates funding to Regional Boards
- Adopts statewide policies
- Approves basin plans

### Regional Board Independence

Regional Boards have **primary responsibility** within their jurisdictions but must:
- Follow State Board precedential decisions
- Obtain State Board approval for basin plans
- Implement statewide policies and permits
- Report to State Board on activities

### Appeal Process

Any person aggrieved by a Regional Board decision may:
