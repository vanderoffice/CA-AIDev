### Transboundary Challenges

The Tijuana River situation illustrates the complexity of managing water quality across international borders:

- **Volume:** Large flows of untreated/partially treated sewage
- **Jurisdiction:** Requires US-Mexico coordination
- **Agencies:** USIBWC, EPA, State/Regional Water Boards, local governments
- **Infrastructure:** Treatment capacity insufficient
- **Enforcement:** Limited authority over Mexican sources
- **Community impact:** Beaches closed, health risks, property values
