- Coastal waters

### Key Water Quality Issues

**Nutrient Loading and Harmful Algal Blooms**
- July-August 2022: Significant HAB caused fish kills
- Bay losing capacity to assimilate nutrients
- Requires 40% reduction in total inorganic nitrogen

**Legacy Contaminants**
- Mercury and PCBs at levels exceeding objectives
- Persistent contamination from historical activities
- Bioaccumulation in fish tissue

**Emerging Contaminants**
- PFAS detected at 22 monitoring sites
- Microplastics
- Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs)

**Urban Runoff**
- 7.2 million people in watershed
- Multiple pollutant pathways
- Trash and debris

### Major Regulatory Programs

**Regional Monitoring Program (RMP)** — Since 1992
- One of world's most comprehensive monitoring programs
- Managed by SF Estuary Institute
- Collaborative partnership: agencies, dischargers, NGOs, scientists
- Specialized workgroups: nutrients, PCBs, CECs, sediment

**Nutrients Watershed Permit**
- First issued 2014
- Reissued July 2024: requires 40% nitrogen reduction in 10 years
- Regulates municipal wastewater treatment plants

**Municipal Regional Stormwater Permit (MRP)**
- Covers Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara counties
- Plus Fairfield, Suisun City, Vallejo
- Trash control requirements
- Green infrastructure implementation
- PCB discharge reduction

### Current Priorities

- Nutrient load reduction
- PFAS and emerging contaminants monitoring
- Wetland restoration for sea level rise adaptation
- PCB source control
- Climate change resilience

**Major Water Bodies:**
- Salinas River
- Monterey Bay
- Santa Maria River
- San Lorenzo River
- Carmel River
- Pajaro River

### Key Water Quality Issues

**Agricultural Contamination**
- Intensive specialty crop production (Salinas Valley)
- Excessive nitrogen fertilizer applications
- Pesticide and salt loading
- Erosion and sedimentation

**Nitrate in Groundwater**
- Elevated concentrations threatening drinking water
- Rural households and small systems affected
- Ongoing agricultural impacts documented

**Pesticides and Emerging Contaminants**
- 1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP)
- Legacy pesticide residues
- Impacts on disadvantaged communities

**Coastal Water Quality**
- Monterey Bay protection
- Beach water quality
- Stormwater runoff from urban areas

### Major Regulatory Programs

**Agricultural Order 4.0** (R3-2021-0040)
- Major shift to performance-based approach
- Previous orders (since 2004) documented ongoing degradation
- Requires specific numeric targets and limits
- Monitoring and reporting to verify improvements
- $7.5 million in support contracts (2009-2019)
- $600+ million in public grants allocated

**Groundwater Protection**
- Drinking Water Well Testing Program
- CCAMP-GAP (Central Coast Ambient Monitoring Program - Groundwater Assessment and Protection)
- Replacement water for contaminated wells
- Focus on disadvantaged communities

**Waste Discharge Requirements**
- Agricultural operations
- Wineries and food processors
- Wastewater treatment facilities

### Current Priorities

- Agricultural Order 4.0 implementation
- Nitrate reduction in groundwater
- Climate change adaptation provisions
- Protection of disadvantaged communities
- Drinking water replacement programs

### Agricultural Order Evolution

| Order | Period | Approach |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Ag Order 1.0 | 2004 | Management practice implementation |
| Ag Order 2.0 | 2012 | Expanded requirements |
| Ag Order 3.0 | 2017 | Enhanced monitoring |
| **Ag Order 4.0** | 2021 | **Performance-based, numeric targets** |

The shift to Ag Order 4.0 reflects recognition that management practice-based approaches alone have not achieved water quality improvement after nearly two decades.
