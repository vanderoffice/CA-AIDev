# Regional Water Board Geographic Boundaries

## Boundary Determination

Regional Water Quality Control Board boundaries were determined based on **hydrologic areas and watersheds**, not political jurisdictions. This watershed-based approach ensures:

- Regulatory authority aligns with natural drainage patterns
- Water quality management addresses entire basins
- Regional conditions (climate, geology, hydrology) are considered

Some boundaries coincidentally follow county lines, but this is incidental to the hydrologic basis.
