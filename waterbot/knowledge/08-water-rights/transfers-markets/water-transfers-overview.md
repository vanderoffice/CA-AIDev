# Water Transfers Overview

## Definition and Purpose

Water transfers are voluntary transactions that reallocate water from willing sellers to willing buyers, enabling flexible management of California's highly variable water supplies. Transfers allow water to move from users with available supplies to users with greater need or higher-value uses.

### Fundamental Principle

The core rule governing all California water transfers:

> "You can transfer water if it is your water and not somebody else's water, provided the transfer does not injure another water right holder or unreasonably affect instream beneficial uses."

This simple principle involves complex legal and hydrological analysis in practice.

## Types of Water Transfers

### Duration Categories

| Transfer Type | Duration | Regulatory Process |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Temporary** | 1 year or less | Expedited approval (45-65 days) |
| **Long-term** | 1-5 years | Standard change petition |
| **Permanent** | Indefinite | Full environmental review |

### Transfer Source Categories

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Surface water** | Rivers, streams, reservoirs |
| **Groundwater substitution** | Replace surface diversions with pumping |
| **Stored water** | Reservoir releases |
| **Conserved water** | Water saved through efficiency |

## Legal Framework

### Enabling Statutes

California Water Code provides the legal foundation for water transfers:

| Code Section | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Section 1725** | Authorizes temporary transfers |
| **Section 1435** | Temporary urgency change petitions |
| **Sections 1700-1737** | Change petition process |
| **Section 1726** | Processing deadlines |

### Central Valley Project Improvement Act (1992)

Federal legislation authorizing CVP water transfers:

- CVP contractors may transfer all or portion of contracted supply
- Transfers may go to other water users, agencies, tribes
- Must be for beneficial use under California law
- Bureau of Reclamation facilitates and approves

## The "No Injury" Rule

### Core Requirements

Before approving any transfer, agencies must find:

1. **No injury to legal water users** - Other water rights holders not harmed
2. **No unreasonable effect** on fish, wildlife, or instream uses
3. **Water is transferable** - Represents "new water" to the system

### What Constitutes "New Water"

Water available for transfer must represent water that would not otherwise be in the watercourse:

- Reduced surface water diversions
- Fallowed cropland (water not applied)
- Groundwater substituted for surface water
- Released stored water

### Injury Analysis

| Factor | Evaluation |
|--------|------------|
| **Senior rights** | Would transfer reduce water for senior users? |
| **Return flows** | Would downstream users lose return flows? |
| **Timing** | Would change in diversion timing affect others? |
| **Streamflow** | Would flows be depleted below necessary levels? |

## Temporary Transfer Process

### Standard Process (Water Code Section 1725)

Temporary transfers lasting one year or less follow an expedited process:

| Step | Timeframe |
|------|-----------|
| File petition | Day 1 |
| Completeness review | 10 days |
| Public notice | 20 days |
| Comment period | 20 days |
| Board decision | 45-65 days total |

### Expedited Process (2026)

Recent streamlining allows 55-day maximum processing:

- Advance notification by January 31
- Pre-coordination with Board staff
- Reduced review time for qualifying transfers

### CEQA Exemption

Temporary transfers involving only consumptively used water are **exempt from CEQA**:

- No environmental impact report required
- Reflects limited duration and reversibility
- Significantly reduces administrative burden

## Long-Term and Permanent Transfers

### Full Change Petition Process

Transfers lasting more than one year require:

1. **Complete petition filing** with Division of Water Rights
2. **CEQA compliance** - Initial study, negative declaration, or EIR
3. **Public notice** and protest period
4. **Protest resolution** - Negotiation or hearing
5. **Board decision** - Approval with conditions or denial

### Environmental Review Requirements

| Project Impact Level | Required Documentation |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Minimal impact | Categorical exemption |
| Minor impact | Negative Declaration |
| Significant impact | Environmental Impact Report |

### Factors Considered in EIR

- Effects on fish and wildlife habitat
- Water quality impacts (temperature, dissolved oxygen)
- Downstream user effects
- Groundwater-surface water interactions
- Cumulative impacts with other transfers

## Third-Party Impacts

### Beyond the "No Injury" Rule

The no injury rule addresses water rights holders but not broader impacts:

| Impact Category | Affected Parties |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Economic** | Agricultural workers, suppliers, local businesses |
| **Fiscal** | County tax revenues, local government budgets |
| **Community** | Rural communities dependent on agriculture |

### Third-Party Protections

Current protections are limited but evolving:

- **20% fallowing cap**: No more than 20% of irrigated acreage in a county may be fallowed for transfer in a single year
- **County economic review**: DWR considers county economic impacts for SWP transfers
- **Emerging equity frameworks**: Growing attention to disadvantaged community impacts

## Area of Origin Protections

### Three Key Statutes

California law protects water-exporting regions:

| Statute | Year | Protection |
|---------|------|------------|
| **County of Origin Law** | 1931 | Counties retain water needed for development |
| **Watershed Protection Statute** | 1933 | CVP cannot deprive areas of needed water |
| **Delta Protection Act** | 1959 | Adequate Delta water supply must be maintained |

### Practical Application

Area of Origin protections:

- Reserve preferential rights to future water needs
- Apply primarily to natural flows, not stored water
- Can be modified by negotiated agreements
- Provide framework for balancing export and local needs

## Approval Agencies

### Multi-Agency Coordination

Water transfers often require approval from multiple agencies:

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| **State Water Board** | Approves water rights changes |
| **Department of Water Resources** | Approves SWP facility use |
| **Bureau of Reclamation** | Approves CVP facility use |
| **California Dept. of Fish & Wildlife** | Reviews fish/wildlife impacts |
| **US Fish & Wildlife Service** | Reviews endangered species impacts |

### Through-Delta Transfers

Transfers crossing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta require:

- Coordination between DWR and Reclamation
- Compliance with biological opinions
- **Limited to July-September** export window
- Capacity constraints at Delta pumping plants

## Transfer Statistics

### Volume and Trends

California water transfers have remained relatively stable:

- **~1.2 million acre-feet per year** transferred since 2000
- Higher volumes during drought years
- Most transfers occur within same county or region
- Growing sophistication of transfer mechanisms

### Drought Response

Transfer activity intensifies during droughts:

- 1991 Drought Water Bank: 389,770 acre-feet allocated
- 2014-2015 drought: Extensive temporary transfers
- 2022-2023: Emergency drought water banks established
