# Water Transfer Mechanisms

## Overview

Water transfers in California utilize various mechanisms to make water available for reallocation. Each mechanism has distinct advantages, limitations, and regulatory requirements. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for water managers, agricultural operations, and policy makers.

## Groundwater Substitution Transfers

### Concept

Groundwater substitution makes surface water available by:

1. Reducing surface water diversions
2. Pumping groundwater to meet local demands
3. Transferring the foregone surface water to buyers

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Basis** | Replace surface diversions with groundwater |
| **Availability** | Limited by aquifer capacity and sustainability |
| **Regulatory oversight** | Subject to SGMA requirements |
| **Transfer water** | Surface water not diverted |

### Calculation Method

Transfer amount = Reduced surface diversion - Streamflow depletion

Groundwater pumping may indirectly reduce surface flows through aquifer-stream interaction, which must be accounted for.

### SGMA Considerations

In basins subject to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act:

- Must comply with Groundwater Sustainability Plans
- May be restricted in critically overdrafted basins
- GSAs may regulate groundwater substitution transfers
- Long-term sustainability must be demonstrated

### Agency Review

| Agency | Review Focus |
|--------|--------------|
| **DWR** | Compliance with groundwater management plans |
| **Bureau of Reclamation** | CVP facility use, regional criteria |
| **GSA** | GSP compliance, basin sustainability |

## Crop Idling and Fallowing

### Concept

Agricultural water made available by:

- Deliberately not planting/irrigating land
- Freeing water that would have been applied
- Transferring the saved water to buyers

### Evapotranspiration of Applied Water (ETAW)

Transfer quantity based on **ETAW** - the portion of applied water actually consumed:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Evaporation** | Water lost from soil and plant surfaces |
| **Transpiration** | Water used by the crop |
| **ETAW total** | Consumptive use = transferable water |

### ETAW Variation by Crop

| Crop Type | Typical ETAW (acre-feet/acre) |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Alfalfa | 4.0 - 5.0 |
| Rice | 3.5 - 4.5 |
| Orchards | 2.5 - 3.5 |
| Row crops | 1.5 - 2.5 |
| Pasture | 2.0 - 3.0 |

### Seasonal Timing

Water availability follows ETAW patterns:

- **May-September**: Primary growing season
- **Peak availability**: June-August
- **Challenge**: Delta export window limited to July-September
- **May-June ETAW**: May require upstream storage

### 20% Fallowing Cap

California limits fallowing to protect rural economies:

- Maximum **20% of irrigated acreage** per county
- Applies to single water year
- Prevents excessive agricultural disruption
- Protects farm workers and local businesses

### Crop Shifting Alternative

An intermediate approach:

- Substitute lower-water crops for higher-water crops
- Transfer the difference in water consumption
- Maintains some agricultural production
- Limited to regions suited to multiple crop types

## Reservoir Release Transfers

### Stored Water Transfers

Water released from reservoirs for transfer:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Source** | Previously stored water |
| **Control** | Reservoir operator manages release |
| **Timing** | Can be timed to meet buyer needs |
| **Limitations** | Storage capacity, release constraints |

### Carryover Storage

Water stored in one year for use in subsequent years:

- Accumulate during wet years
- Withdraw during dry years
- Provides temporal flexibility
- Requires adequate storage infrastructure

### State Water Project Storage

SWP facilities available for storage and transfer:

| Facility | Capacity |
|----------|----------|
| Oroville Dam | 3.5 million AF |
| San Luis Reservoir | 2 million AF (shared with CVP) |
| Castaic Lake | 324,000 AF |

### Central Valley Project Storage

Major CVP reservoirs:

| Facility | Capacity |
|----------|----------|
| Shasta Dam | 4.5 million AF |
| Trinity Lake | 2.4 million AF |
| Folsom Lake | 977,000 AF |
| New Melones | 2.4 million AF |

## Conserved Water Transfers

### Concept

Water saved through efficiency improvements:

- Irrigation system upgrades
- Soil moisture monitoring
- Improved scheduling
- Reduced distribution losses

### Advantages

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Production maintained** | Farming continues |
| **Infrastructure investment** | Creates lasting improvements |
| **Community acceptance** | Less disruptive than fallowing |

### Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Smaller quantities** | Less water per transfer |
| **Capital costs** | Requires upfront investment |
| **Verification** | Measuring actual conservation difficult |
| **Time to implement** | Conservation measures take time |

### Regulatory Treatment

- Must demonstrate "new water" created
- Baseline water use must be established
- Conservation measures must be documented
- Water saved must be quantified

## Exchange Agreements

### Concept

Agencies exchange water supplies rather than physically moving water:

- Agency A provides water to Agency B's area
- Agency B provides equivalent water to Agency A's area
- Reduces conveyance costs and losses
- Optimizes timing for both parties

### Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reduced wheeling costs** | Less infrastructure use |
| **Lower losses** | Less conveyance = less loss |
| **Flexibility** | Can optimize timing |
| **Mutual benefit** | Both parties gain |

### Example: San Gabriel Valley Exchange

Metropolitan Water District arrangement:

- MWD delivers 2 AF surface water to partner
- Partner provides 1 AF groundwater to MWD
- 2:1 exchange ratio
- Benefits both parties' objectives

### Seasonal Exchanges

Agencies with complementary needs:

- One agency has high summer demand
- Another has high winter demand
- Exchange optimizes supply timing
- Both achieve greater reliability

## Wheeling Agreements

### Concept

Physical conveyance of water through another agency's facilities:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Wheeling** | Using others' infrastructure to move water |
| **Fee** | Compensation to facility owner |
| **Terms** | Quantity, timing, duration specified |

### Wheeling Through Major Systems

Most California transfers require wheeling through:

- State Water Project facilities
- Central Valley Project facilities
- Local district infrastructure

### Warren Act Contracts

For non-CVP water through CVP facilities:

- Legal authorization required
- Bureau of Reclamation issues contract
- Establishes terms and compensation
- Required for through-Delta CVP transfers

### Through-Delta Constraints

Transfers crossing the Delta face:

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Seasonal window** | July-September only |
| **Biological opinions** | Protect endangered species |
| **Pumping capacity** | Limited export capacity |
| **Coordination** | DWR/Reclamation must coordinate |

## Groundwater Banking

### Concept

Store water in aquifers during wet periods, recover during dry periods:

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Storage** | Recharge aquifer with surplus water |
| **Banking** | Water held in underground storage |
| **Recovery** | Pump stored water when needed |

### Banking Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Spreading basins** | Surface infiltration into aquifer |
| **Injection wells** | Direct aquifer injection |
| **In-lieu storage** | Deliver surface water, defer pumping |

### Major Banking Programs

Metropolitan Water District partnerships:

| Program | Partner | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Semitropic** | Semitropic WSD | Kern County |
| **Antelope Valley-East Kern** | AVEK | Northern LA County |
| **Mojave** | Mojave WA | High Desert |

### Banking Economics

- Significant capital investment required
- Long-term partnerships necessary
- Return ratios vary (typically 80-90%)
- Water losses in storage and recovery

## Transfer Through State Water Project

### SWP Transfer Role

DWR facilitates transfers using SWP infrastructure:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Conveyance** | Transport water through California Aqueduct |
| **Storage** | Temporary storage in SWP reservoirs |
| **Coordination** | Manage export timing |

### SWP Transfer Requirements

Transfers must satisfy that they:

- Will not harm any legal water user
- Will not unreasonably affect fish and wildlife
- Will not unreasonably affect county economy

### Export Capacity

Delta export capacity limits transfer volumes:

- Banks Pumping Plant: 10,300 cfs
- Capacity shared with SWP deliveries
- Biological opinion restrictions apply
- Peak capacity rarely available

## Transfer Through Central Valley Project

### CVP Transfer Programs
