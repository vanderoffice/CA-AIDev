# California Water Markets

## Overview

California has maintained an active water market since the 1980s, with water transfers serving as a critical mechanism for managing variable supplies and competing regional demands. Unlike stock or commodity markets, water is traded through bilateral negotiations rather than centralized exchanges.

## Market Structure

### Market Prerequisites

Effective water markets require:

1. **Clear water rights** - Established, documented rights
2. **Transaction ability** - Legal framework for transfers
3. **Market information** - Price discovery mechanisms

## Water Pricing

### Extraordinary Price Disparities

California water pricing varies dramatically by source and user:

| User Category | Average Price ($/AF) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Agricultural (subsidized) | $36 |
| Urban suppliers | $722 |
| Some agricultural (CVP) | <$40 |
| Some urban (transfer) | $2,000+ |

### Price Drivers

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Source** | Federal water cheapest |
| **Distance** | Conveyance adds cost |
| **Scarcity** | Drought increases prices |
| **Infrastructure** | Pumping/storage costs |
| **Regulatory** | Approval complexity |

### State Water Project Costs

SWP water costs vary significantly by delivery location:

| Region | Approximate Cost ($/AF) |
|--------|------------------------|
| San Joaquin Valley | $250 |
| Southern California | $800-1,200 |
| Central Coast | $1,440 |
| San Gorgonio Pass | $2,870 |

### Market Implications

Price disparities create:

- **Conservation disincentives** in low-price agricultural regions
- **High procurement costs** for urban areas
- **Missing price signals** that don't reflect scarcity
- **Transfer opportunities** when prices differ significantly

## Water Banks

### Concept

Organized programs that aggregate water supplies:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purchase** | Buy water from willing sellers |
| **Storage** | Hold water in reservoirs or aquifers |
| **Allocation** | Distribute to priority users |
| **Emergency response** | Mobilize supplies during crises |

### 1991 Drought Water Bank

Pioneering emergency water bank:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Established** | February 1991 |
| **Volume allocated** | 389,770 acre-feet |
| **Primary mechanism** | Agricultural fallowing |
| **Priorities** | Municipal/industrial, agricultural, fish/wildlife, carryover |

### Drought Water Bank Principles

The 1991 program established enduring principles:

1. Voluntary participation by sellers
2. Competitive prices for agricultural water
3. Priority allocation to critical needs
4. State coordination of operations
5. Environmental review integration

### Subsequent Drought Banks

Programs modeled on 1991 experience:

- 2014-2015 drought transfer programs
- 2022-2023 emergency drought banks
- Demonstrated scalability of approach

## Major Market Participants
