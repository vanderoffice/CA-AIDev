## Water Availability Analysis

### Requirement

Applicants must demonstrate that **unappropriated water is available** to supply the requested appropriation.

### Analysis Components

1. **Watershed Hydrology**
   - Historical streamflow data
   - Seasonal flow patterns
   - Drought year analysis

2. **Existing Rights Inventory**
   - All senior water rights on the source
   - Amounts allocated to existing users
   - Seasonal patterns of senior diversions

3. **Environmental Flows**
   - Instream flow requirements
   - Public trust obligations
   - Endangered species needs

4. **Surplus Determination**
   - Total supply minus committed uses
   - Water available for new appropriation
   - Reliability analysis

### Fully Appropriated Streams

The State Water Board maintains a list of **fully appropriated stream systems** where no unappropriated water is available during specified periods:

- Applications for these streams during listed periods **cannot be approved**
- Some streams are fully appropriated year-round
- Others only during dry season months
- Updated periodically based on water availability assessments

## Environmental Review (CEQA)

### California Environmental Quality Act Requirements

Most water rights applications require environmental review under CEQA:

| Project Type | Typical Review Level |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Minor projects (<5 AF) | Categorical exemption may apply |
| Small projects | Initial Study / Negative Declaration |
| Significant projects | Environmental Impact Report (EIR) |

### State Water Board Role

The State Water Board serves as **Lead Agency** for CEQA review of water rights applications:

- Prepares or reviews environmental documents
- Considers cumulative impacts
- Identifies mitigation measures
- Makes CEQA findings before permit issuance

### Common Environmental Issues

- **Fish and wildlife impacts**: Effects on aquatic habitat
- **Water quality**: Changes to temperature, dissolved oxygen
- **Downstream users**: Effects on other water rights holders
- **Groundwater**: Surface water-groundwater interactions
- **Cultural resources**: Historical and archaeological sites

## Public Notice and Protest Process

### Public Notice Requirements

After an application is deemed complete, the Division:

1. **Publishes notice** in a newspaper of general circulation
2. **Posts notice** on State Water Board website
3. **Notifies** adjacent water rights holders
4. **Allows 60-day period** for protests or comments

### Protests

Any person may file a protest alleging the proposed appropriation would:

- Injure their legal rights
- Harm the public interest
- Damage fish and wildlife
- Conflict with water quality standards

### Protest Resolution

| Resolution Path | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Negotiated settlement** | Parties agree on conditions |
| **Dismissal** | Protest lacks merit |
| **Hearing** | Contested matter before Board |

### Hearing Process

If protests cannot be resolved:

1. Matter assigned to hearing officer
2. Evidentiary hearing conducted
3. Hearing officer prepares proposed decision
4. State Water Board adopts final decision
5. Judicial review available

## Processing Timeline

### Typical Duration

Application processing typically takes **5-7 years** or longer:

| Phase | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Completeness review | 30-90 days |
| Water availability analysis | 6-18 months |
| Environmental review | 1-3 years |
| Public notice and protests | 6-24 months |
| Hearing (if needed) | 1-2 years |
| Board action | 3-6 months |

### Factors Affecting Timeline

- Complexity of project
- Completeness of application
- Number of protests
- Environmental sensitivity of location
- Staff workload and priorities

### Application Backlog

The Division of Water Rights maintains a significant backlog:

- Priority given to applications for instream beneficial uses
- Municipal supply applications may receive expedited processing
- Simple projects processed faster than complex ones

## Board Findings for Permit Issuance

### Required Determinations

Before issuing a permit, the Board must find:

1. **Unappropriated water exists** in sufficient quantities
2. **Proposed use is beneficial** under California law
3. **Appropriation is in the public interest**
4. **No injury** to other legal users of water
5. **Environmental protection** adequately addressed
6. **CEQA compliance** is satisfied

### Public Interest Factors

The Board considers:

- Effect on public trust resources
- Effect on fish and wildlife
- Consistency with regional water plans
- Water conservation and efficiency
- Economic benefits and costs
- Environmental justice considerations
