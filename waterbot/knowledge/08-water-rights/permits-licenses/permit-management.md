# Water Rights Permit Management

## Overview

Once a water right permit or license is issued, ongoing management involves annual reporting, requesting changes when needed, and maintaining compliance with permit terms. This document covers the administrative processes for managing existing water rights.

## Annual Reporting Requirements

### CalWATRS System

The **California Water Tracking and Reporting System (CalWATRS)** is the State Water Board's online portal for water rights reporting:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Launched** | 2023 (replacing eWRIMS) |
| **Purpose** | Centralized water rights data management |
| **Users** | All water rights holders |
| **Access** | Online at waterboards.ca.gov |

### Who Must Report

Annual reporting is required for:

- All post-1914 permit and license holders
- Pre-1914 appropriative rights claimants
- Riparian rights claimants (under SB 88/SB 389)
- Groundwater users in adjudicated basins (some)

### Report Contents

Annual reports must include:

1. **Diversion Data**
   - Monthly quantities diverted
   - Maximum instantaneous rate
   - Total annual volume

2. **Use Information**
   - Purpose of use
   - Place of use
   - Acreage served (if irrigation)

3. **Measurement Method**
   - How diversions were measured
   - Measurement device type
   - Calibration status

4. **Water Conservation**
   - Conservation measures employed
   - Efficiency improvements

### Filing Deadlines

| Report Type | Due Date |
|-------------|----------|
| **Supplemental Statement** | July 1 (for prior water year) |
| **Progress Report (permits)** | As specified in permit |
| **License Report** | July 1 annually |

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Violation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Late filing | $500 per month late |
| Failure to file | Up to $1,000/day |
| False reporting | Up to $5,000/day + potential criminal penalties |

## Change Petitions

### Types of Changes

Water rights holders may petition to change:

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Point of diversion** | Location where water is taken |
| **Place of use** | Where water is applied |
| **Purpose of use** | How water is used |
| **Point of rediversion** | Secondary diversion points |

### Change Petition Process

1. **File petition** with Division of Water Rights
2. **Pay filing fee** (varies by change type)
3. **Public notice** published
4. **Protest period** (usually 60 days)
5. **Staff review** of petition
6. **Board action** (approval, denial, or conditions)

### Standard for Approval

Changes are approved only if:

- No other legal user of water will be **injured**
- Change will not **unreasonably affect** fish, wildlife, or other instream uses
- Petitioner has legal authority to make the change

### No Injury Rule

The "no injury" rule is paramount:

- Senior rights holders cannot be harmed
- Timing of diversions matters
- Location changes may affect return flows
- Burden of proof on petitioner

### Change Petition Fees

| Change Type | Approximate Fee Range |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| Minor change | $500 - $1,500 |
| Moderate change | $1,500 - $5,000 |
| Major change | $5,000 - $15,000+ |

**Note**: Fees vary based on complexity and are updated periodically.

## Time Extensions

### When Extensions Are Needed

Permittees may need extensions when:

- Construction delays occur
- Funding not yet secured
- Environmental review prolonged
- Legal challenges pending
- Market conditions changed

### Extension Petition Requirements

Petitions must demonstrate **good cause** for delay:

1. Circumstances beyond permittee's control
2. Diligent effort to develop the project
3. Reasonable likelihood of completion
4. Continued public interest in the project

### Extension Limitations

- Extensions are not guaranteed
- Board has discretion to deny
- Repeated extensions may be scrutinized
- Eventually, undeveloped permits may be revoked

### Revocation for Non-Development

The Board may revoke permits when:

- Development deadlines repeatedly missed
- No good cause for continued delay
- Project appears abandoned
- Public interest no longer served
