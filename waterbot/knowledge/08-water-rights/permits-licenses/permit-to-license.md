# From Permit to License: The Two-Phase System

## Overview

California's post-1914 appropriative water rights system operates through a **two-phase process**: an initial permit that authorizes development, followed by a license that confirms the final water right. This system ensures water is actually put to beneficial use before a permanent right is confirmed.

## Phase 1: The Water Right Permit

### Nature of a Permit

A water right permit is a **conditional authorization** to:

- Construct diversion works
- Develop a water supply project
- Begin putting water to beneficial use

### Key Permit Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Status** | Conditional, not final |
| **Duration** | Time-limited with deadlines |
| **Transferability** | Can be transferred with Board approval |
| **Priority date** | Established at application filing |
| **Regulatory status** | Subject to full Board oversight |

### What a Permit Authorizes

The permit authorizes the permittee to:

1. Divert water from the specified source
2. At the specified point of diversion
3. For the specified purposes
4. Up to the specified maximum amounts
5. Subject to all permit terms and conditions

### What a Permit Does NOT Establish

A permit alone does **not** establish:

- A confirmed water right
- The final amount of the right
- Immunity from further conditions
- Freedom from regulatory oversight

## Standard Permit Terms

### Development Schedule

Every permit includes deadlines for project development:

| Milestone | Typical Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Construction start** | Within 2 years of permit issuance |
| **Construction complete** | Specified date (varies by project) |
| **Beneficial use** | Full beneficial use by specified date |

### Extensions

Permittees may petition for time extensions:

- Must demonstrate **good cause** for delay
- Cannot extend indefinitely
- Board has discretion to grant or deny
- Pattern of extensions may raise concerns

### Standard Conditions

All permits include conditions addressing:

1. **Maximum diversion rate** (cubic feet per second)
2. **Maximum annual volume** (acre-feet per year)
3. **Season of diversion** (months when diversions allowed)
4. **Bypass flows** (minimum flows to protect downstream uses)
5. **Monitoring and reporting** (measurement and annual reports)
6. **Fish protection** (screens, ladders, other measures)

### Site-Specific Conditions

Additional conditions may address:

- Environmental mitigation requirements
- Coordination with other water users
- Water quality protection measures
- Construction specifications
- Adaptive management provisions

## Phase 2: The Water Right License

### Nature of a License

A water right license is the **final confirmation** of a post-1914 appropriative water right, issued after the permittee has:

- Completed construction of diversion works
- Put water to full beneficial use
- Complied with all permit terms

### License Application Process

After completing the permitted project:

1. **Permittee applies** for license inspection
2. **Division staff inspects** the project
3. **Staff verifies**:
   - Diversion works constructed as permitted
   - Water put to beneficial use
   - Compliance with permit terms
4. **Staff measures** actual water use
5. **Board issues license** confirming the water right

### License Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Status** | Final confirmation of water right |
| **Duration** | Perpetual (subject to beneficial use) |
| **Amount** | Based on actual beneficial use |
| **Recording** | Recorded with county recorder |
| **Priority** | Same as original application date |

## The Beneficial Use Requirement

### Permits vs. Licenses

| Aspect | Permit | License |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Amount stated** | Maximum authorized | Actual beneficial use |
| **Basis** | Requested and approved | Verified through inspection |
| **Finality** | Conditional | Final |

### License Amount Determination

The licensed amount is based on **actual beneficial use**, not the permitted amount:

- If permittee used less than permitted, license reflects actual use
- License cannot exceed permitted amount
- Unused permit capacity is not converted to license

**Example**: A permit authorizes 1,000 acre-feet/year. After development, the permittee only beneficially uses 750 acre-feet/year. The license will be for 750 acre-feet/year—the remaining 250 acre-feet reverts to public waters.

## Progressive Development

### Partial Development

If a project is developed in phases:

- Initial license may be issued for completed portions
- Remaining permit capacity stays under permit status
- Final license issued when full development complete

### Revocation for Non-Development

Permits may be **revoked** if:

- Development schedule not met
- Extensions not granted or exhausted
- Project abandoned
- Permittee fails to diligently pursue development

## License Terms and Conditions

### Carryover Conditions

Permit conditions may carry forward to the license:

- Bypass flow requirements
- Fish screen obligations
- Monitoring requirements
- Environmental mitigation measures

### Modification of Conditions

The Board retains authority to modify license conditions:

- If needed to protect other legal users
- If needed to protect public trust resources
- If circumstances significantly change
- Through formal amendment process

## Recording Requirements

### County Recording

Upon issuance, licenses are:

1. **Recorded** with the county recorder in each county where water is used
2. **Indexed** as an encumbrance on the place of use
3. **Searchable** through county records

### Purpose of Recording

- Provides public notice of the water right
- Creates chain of title for water rights
- Facilitates water rights transfers
- Assists title searches for real property

## Maintaining License Rights

### Ongoing Obligations

License holders must:

1. **Continue beneficial use** of the water
2. **File annual reports** through CalWATRS
3. **Comply with** license terms and conditions
4. **Avoid waste** and unreasonable use
5. **Maintain** diversion works

### Forfeiture Risk

Licensed rights can be **forfeited** if:

- Water not beneficially used for **5+ consecutive years**
- Board makes affirmative finding of non-use
- No recognized excuse for non-use (e.g., drought)

### Distinguishing Forfeiture from Non-Use

| Situation | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Temporary non-use with intent to resume | No forfeiture |
| Non-use due to drought/emergency | No forfeiture |
| Intentional abandonment of use | Forfeiture may apply |
| Extended non-use without excuse | Forfeiture may apply |

## The Permit-to-License Backlog

### Current Status

The Division of Water Rights has a significant backlog of permits awaiting:

- License inspections
- Beneficial use verification
- License issuance

### Backlog Implications

- Many water users operate under permits for decades
- Staff resource limitations delay license processing
- Permits remain subject to development deadlines
- Board periodically addresses oldest permits
