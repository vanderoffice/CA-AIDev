# Appropriative Water Rights Requirements

## Elements to Establish Appropriative Rights

To establish a valid appropriative water right in California, several essential elements must be satisfied. These requirements ensure water is allocated efficiently and for legitimate purposes.

### Five Core Requirements

1. **Intent to Appropriate**: Must manifest clear intent to divert and use water
2. **Actual Diversion**: Must physically divert water from its natural source
3. **Beneficial Use**: Water must be applied to a recognized beneficial purpose
4. **Reasonable Use**: The manner and amount of use must be reasonable
5. **Due Diligence**: Must diligently pursue development of the water right

## Beneficial Use Requirements

### Definition

Beneficial use is the fundamental basis and measure of appropriative water rights. Without beneficial use, no water right can be established or maintained.

### Recognized Beneficial Uses (Water Code Section 1242)

- **Domestic and household** purposes
- **Irrigation and agriculture**
- **Fish and wildlife** preservation and enhancement
- **Power generation**
- **Municipal and industrial** uses
- **Mining**
- **Navigation**
- **Recreation**
- **Preservation of natural ecosystems** and scenic values
- **Stockwatering**
- **Frost protection**
- **Heat control**

### Amount Limited by Beneficial Use

The quantity of water that may be diverted is measured as the **maximum amount that has been put to beneficial use** during the period of appropriation—not the amount applied for or theoretically available.

This ensures:
- Rights are tied to real, observable diversion and use
- Speculative or unused rights cannot be maintained
- Water resources are available for other appropriators

## Reasonable Use Doctrine

### Constitutional Mandate

Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution and Water Code Section 100 establish that:

- All water use must be **reasonable**
- The right to water does not extend to **waste** or **unreasonable use**
- Rights do not include unreasonable **method of use** or **method of diversion**

### What Constitutes Reasonable Use

Reasonable use is evaluated based on:
- Competing water demands
- Available supplies
- Public interest considerations
- Efficiency of use
- Historical practice in the area
- Whether water is being wasted

### Unreasonable Uses (Examples Found by Courts/Board)

The State Water Board and courts have found these practices unreasonable:

- Excessive conveyance losses when transporting water
- Failure to adopt conservation measures
- Failure to use efficient irrigation techniques
- Failure to repair leaking pipes and canals
- Using more water than necessary for the stated purpose
- Continuing historical practices when more efficient alternatives exist

### Key Principle

Even a senior water right that was historically exercised reasonably may be found **unreasonable today** if:
- Technology has improved
- Understanding of environmental values has changed
- Conservation methods have become available
- Circumstances have materially changed

## Diversion and Control Requirements

### Physical Control

Appropriative rights require **actual physical control** over the water:
- Must construct diversion works (dams, ditches, pumps, pipes)
- Must physically capture and remove water from its natural course
- Mere intent without physical diversion is insufficient

### Point of Diversion

The permit or license specifies:
- Exact location where water may be diverted
- Type of diversion works authorized
- Any required fish screens or environmental protections

### Changing Diversion

Changes to point of diversion require a **change petition** to the State Water Board, which evaluates whether the change would:
- Injure other legal users
- Unreasonably affect fish, wildlife, or other instream uses
- Be consistent with public interest

## Non-Wasteful Use Standards

### Waste Prevention

California law mandates prevention of water waste. Wasteful practices include:

**Physical Waste:**
- Allowing diverted water to return to stream without use
- Excessive seepage from unlined canals
- Spilling water past points of use
- Over-application beyond crop or land needs

**Economic Waste:**
- Using high-quality water where lower quality would suffice
- Inefficient application methods
- Failure to recycle or reuse where feasible

### Conservation Obligation

Water rights holders have an affirmative obligation to:
- Implement reasonable conservation measures
- Update practices as technology improves
- Cooperate with state conservation programs

## Due Diligence Requirements

### Development Timeline

Appropriative rights require diligent pursuit of development:

**For Post-1914 Rights:**
- Construction must commence within time specified in permit (typically 2 years)
- Water must be put to beneficial use within permit timeline
- Progress reports required to demonstrate due diligence

**For Pre-1914 Rights:**
Historical requirement to:
- Commence construction promptly after posting notice
- Complete diversion works with reasonable dispatch
- Apply water to beneficial use without unreasonable delay

### Consequences of Failure

Failure to exercise due diligence may result in:
- Permit revocation (post-1914)
- Loss of priority date
- Forfeiture of the water right
- Subordination to more diligent appropriators

## Post-1914 Permit Requirements

### Application Elements

Applications to the State Water Board must specify:
- Source of water
- Point(s) of diversion
- Place of use
- Purpose of use
- Season of diversion
- Estimated quantity to be diverted
- Construction schedule

### State Water Board Findings

Before issuing a permit, the Board must determine:

1. **Water Availability**: Unappropriated water is available at the time and quantity requested
2. **Public Interest**: The proposed appropriation serves the public interest

### Permit Conditions

Permits typically include conditions regarding:
- Maximum diversion rate (cubic feet per second)
- Maximum annual volume (acre-feet)
- Season of diversion
- Fish screens and bypass flows
- Environmental protections
- Reporting requirements

## Statement of Water Diversion and Use

### Reporting Obligation

All water diverters in California—including appropriative rights holders—must file **Statements of Water Diversion and Use** with the State Water Board.

### Required Information

- Source of water
- Amount diverted
- Purpose of use
- Method of diversion
- Place of use
- Compliance with permit conditions

### Purpose

Reporting creates a comprehensive database allowing the Board to:
- Monitor water use across the state
- Verify compliance with permits
- Identify waste and unreasonable use
- Manage allocation during shortages
