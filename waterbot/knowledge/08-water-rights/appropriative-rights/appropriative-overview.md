# Appropriative Water Rights Overview

## Definition and Legal Basis

An appropriative water right is the legal permission to divert and use a specific quantity of water from a particular source for a beneficial purpose, independent of whether the user owns land adjacent to that water source. This distinguishes appropriative rights from riparian rights, which attach to land through proximity to a water body.

Water in California is not privately owned. The right to use water is a **usufructuary right**—a right to use something but not to own it. Appropriative rights holders possess no property interest in the water itself but have the legal right to divert and use a certain quantity under specified conditions.

Key characteristics of appropriative rights:
- Exist regardless of relationship between land and water
- Depend on physical control and beneficial use
- May be sold or transferred to another user
- Allow long-term storage of water (unlike riparian rights)
- Can transport water outside the natural watershed

## The "First in Time, First in Right" Doctrine

The foundational principle governing appropriative rights is **"first in time, first in right"** (Latin: *qui prior est in tempore, potior est in jure*). This doctrine establishes:

- Priority is determined by the date the appropriator first manifests intent to develop the right
- Not determined by when water actually begins to be used
- Not determined by the size of the water right
- The priority date is fixed and does not change even if the right is transferred or sold

**Priority During Shortages:**
When water supplies diminish, junior rights are restricted before senior rights:
1. Most recently established rights are curtailed first
2. Older rights are curtailed only if shortage continues
3. Pre-1914 appropriators have higher priority than post-1914 appropriators
4. Riparian rights holders have highest priority among all water rights

## Historical Development

### Gold Rush Origins (1848-1855)

California's appropriative rights system emerged from the California Gold Rush beginning in January 1848. Gold mining required enormous quantities of water for hydraulic and placer mining operations.

Miners faced unique challenges:
- Gold deposits were dispersed across public lands
- Water was scarce in certain mining regions
- No governmental authority existed to regulate water use
- Eastern riparian doctrine did not fit mining conditions

**Mining Practice Established:**
Miners developed a system of posting notice at the point of diversion to stake water claims, analogous to staking land claims for gold. This custom was later affirmed by California courts.

### Irwin v. Phillips (1855)

The landmark California Supreme Court decision in **Irwin v. Phillips** (1855) established appropriative rights doctrine as California law:

- Held that on public mineral lands, prior appropriation governs water rights
- Granted the right to divert water for mining to the first appropriator
- First appropriator's rights superior even against subsequent claimants of riparian land
- Rejected application of common law riparian doctrine to California's circumstances

The court recognized that:
- Common law protecting natural streamflow developed where water was abundant
- California's mining regions required different rules
- Miners had invested substantial capital in water infrastructure
- The "first in time, first in right" principle better served justice

### Water Commission Act of 1913

For decades, California's appropriative rights system operated without formal governmental oversight. By the early 20th century, conflicts multiplied and systematic allocation became necessary.

The Water Commission Act of 1913:
- Created the State Water Commission
- Established first formal permitting system for appropriating water
- Took effect December 1914
- Created the critical distinction between pre-1914 and post-1914 rights

## Constitutional Basis: Article X, Section 2

The cornerstone of modern California water law is **Article X, Section 2** of the California Constitution, added in 1976 through Proposition 14.

### Key Provisions

The constitutional language declares:

1. California's water resources must be put to **beneficial use** to the fullest extent possible
2. **Waste and unreasonable use** must be prevented
3. **Conservation** must be pursued with a view toward reasonable and beneficial use
4. The right to water is **limited** to water reasonably required for beneficial use
5. Rights do not extend to waste, unreasonable use, or unreasonable method of diversion

### Significance

Before this amendment, riparian rights holders were not required to put water to reasonable and beneficial use. The constitutional amendment resolved this conflict by:

- Imposing reasonable and beneficial use requirements on **all** water appropriations
- Applying to both riparian and appropriative rights
- Providing the State Water Board with authority to:
  - Investigate water use
  - Determine whether use is reasonable
  - Take action to prevent waste and unreasonable use

The California Supreme Court has interpreted Article X, Section 2 as **self-executing**—requiring all branches of government and administrative agencies to implement its principles.

## Distinction from Riparian Rights

| Feature | Appropriative Rights | Riparian Rights |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Land requirement | None | Must own land adjacent to watercourse |
| How acquired | Permit/license (post-1914) or historic use (pre-1914) | Automatically with land ownership |
| Transferability | Freely transferable | Cannot be transferred separately from land |
| Storage | Long-term storage allowed | Limited storage rights |
| Place of use | Can be used outside watershed | Generally limited to riparian parcel |
| Priority | Based on date of appropriation | Equal sharing among riparians |

## State Water Board Authority

The State Water Resources Control Board administers appropriative rights through:

- **Division of Water Rights**: Handles permitting, licensing, monitoring, and enforcement
- **Permit system**: Reviews applications for new appropriations
- **Water availability analysis**: Determines if unappropriated water exists
- **Public interest determination**: Evaluates whether appropriation serves public needs
- **Monitoring**: Maintains records of all water right permits and licenses
- **Enforcement**: Issues curtailment orders during shortages
