# Appropriative Water Rights Priority System

## How Priority Dates Work

### Establishing the Priority Date

**Post-1914 Rights:**
The priority date is the date the application is filed with the State Water Resources Control Board's Division of Water Rights. This date is established regardless of:
- Whether the application is ultimately approved, modified, or denied
- When water actually begins to be used
- The size of the water right

**Pre-1914 Rights:**
The priority date is when the appropriator first manifested intent to develop the right, typically through:
- Posting notice of the claim at the point of diversion
- Commencing construction of diversion works
- Historical evidence (newspapers, mining records, county recorder documents)

### Priority Date Characteristics

- **Fixed**: Does not change even if the right is transferred, sold, or suspended
- **Permanent**: Remains with the water right throughout its existence
- **Determinative**: Controls allocation during shortages

## The Priority Hierarchy

When water is insufficient to satisfy all claims, rights are allocated in this order:

### 1. Riparian Rights (Highest Priority)
- Share equally among themselves through "correlative rights"
- Not based on time of establishment
- Tied to land ownership adjacent to watercourse

### 2. Pre-1914 Appropriative Rights
- Priority among themselves based on date of appropriation
- Older (more senior) rights have priority over newer (more junior) rights
- Not subject to State Water Board permitting system

### 3. Post-1914 Appropriative Rights
- Priority based on application filing date
- Administered through permit and license system
- Subject to State Water Board oversight

### 4. Pueblo Rights (Limited Application)
- Historical rights of municipalities founded under Spanish/Mexican rule
- Limited to specific cities (Los Angeles, San Diego)
- Complex legal status

## Water Allocation During Shortages

### Normal Conditions

When water supplies are adequate:
- All appropriators may divert according to permit/license terms
- No curtailment necessary
- Full beneficial use allowed

### Shortage Conditions

When supplies diminish:

1. **Junior rights curtailed first**: Most recently established rights are restricted first
2. **Cascade up the priority ladder**: Progressively older rights curtailed as shortage worsens
3. **Senior rights last affected**: Only in extreme shortages do the most senior rights face curtailment

### Extreme Shortage Conditions

During severe drought:
- Even senior rights may be curtailed
- State Water Board may restrict all uses except:
  - Public health and safety needs
  - Critical environmental resources
  - Human consumption minimums

## Curtailment Procedures

### State Water Board Authority

The Division of Water Rights implements curtailment through:

1. **Water availability analysis**: Determines available supply
2. **Demand assessment**: Calculates total rights claims
3. **Curtailment order issuance**: Notifies affected users
4. **Enforcement**: Monitors compliance

### Curtailment Order Contents

Orders specify:
- Which water rights are affected
- Degree of curtailment (partial or complete)
- Effective date
- Duration (or conditions for lifting)
- Reporting requirements

### Notification Process

- Affected rights holders receive formal notice
- Orders posted on State Water Board website
- Email/mail notification to registered users
- Public announcements during major drought events

## Legal Protections for Senior Appropriators

### Priority System Protections

Senior rights holders benefit from:
- Last to be curtailed during shortages
- Right to full allocation before junior users receive any
- Legal standing to challenge junior diversions
- Protection against injury from new appropriations

### Limitations on Protections

Senior rights are still subject to:
- **Reasonable use doctrine**: Cannot waste water
- **Public trust doctrine**: Must not harm public trust resources
- **Article X, Section 2**: Constitutional mandate for beneficial use
- **State emergency authority**: Governor's drought emergency powers

### Legal Challenges

The 2022 California Court of Appeal decision in **California Water Curtailment Cases** created significant uncertainty:

- Court held State Water Board lacked jurisdiction under Water Code Section 1052(a) to curtail pre-1914 rights based solely on insufficient water
- Pre-1914 rights were not "subject to" the post-1914 permitting regime
- Decision created gap in Board's enforcement authority
- Legislative proposals (AB 1337) seek to clarify Board's curtailment authority

## Real-World Priority Examples

### Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta

During 2014-2015 drought:
- State Water Board issued curtailment orders affecting thousands of water rights
- Post-1914 junior rights holders ordered to cease diversions
- Some pre-1914 rights holders also curtailed
- Legal challenges resulted regarding Board authority

### Scott River and Shasta River Watersheds

Priority system implementation:
- Senior rights (often pre-1914 agricultural) maintained diversions
- Junior rights curtailed to protect senior users
- Fish and wildlife concerns addressed through separate regulatory authority

### Russian River Basin

Complex priority disputes involving:
- Municipal water suppliers with senior rights
- Agricultural users with various priority dates
- Environmental flows for endangered species
- Frost protection demands competing with other uses

## Priority Disputes

### Common Dispute Types

1. **Priority date disputes**: Disagreement over when rights were established
2. **Quantity disputes**: How much water a senior right entitles
3. **Injury claims**: Junior users claiming senior's diversion changed
4. **Abandonment/forfeiture**: Claims that senior rights were lost through non-use

### Resolution Methods

- **State Water Board proceedings**: Administrative hearings
- **Court adjudications**: Comprehensive basin-wide determinations
- **Mediation/settlement**: Negotiated agreements between parties

### Burden of Proof

For pre-1914 rights:
- Claimant must prove the priority date through credible evidence
- Historical documentation is critical
- Courts examine newspapers, mining records, county documents, testimony

## Implications for Water Users

### For Senior Rights Holders

- **Security**: Greater reliability during droughts
- **Value**: Senior rights command premium prices in water markets
- **Responsibility**: Must still use water reasonably and beneficially

### For Junior Rights Holders

- **Risk**: Higher likelihood of curtailment
- **Planning**: Must prepare for reduced or zero allocation during droughts
- **Options**: May seek to acquire senior rights through purchase or transfer
- **Supplemental sources**: Often invest in groundwater or storage

### For Prospective Appropriators

- **Current reality**: Most California streams are fully appropriated
- **Limited options**: Few opportunities for new surface water rights
- **Alternatives**: Groundwater, recycled water, water purchases, conservation

## Climate Change Impacts

### Shifting Water Availability

Climate change is altering:
- Total amount of water available
- Timing of water availability (earlier snowmelt)
- Frequency and severity of droughts
- Reliability of historical flow patterns

### Implications for Priority System

- Fixed priority dates assume stable hydrology
- Declining supplies increase curtailment frequency
- Senior rights become more valuable
- Junior rights face greater uncertainty
- Potential pressure for system reform
