# Groundwater Rights Overview (Pre-SGMA Framework)

## Historical Treatment of Groundwater in California

### Development of Groundwater Law

California's groundwater rights system evolved through judicial decisions over more than a century. The foundational case, **Katz v. Walkinshaw (1903)**, established that groundwater was subject to the same "reasonable use" provision that governed other water rights.

Prior to Katz:
- English common law principles of absolute ownership prevailed
- Landowners could pump groundwater without limitation
- No consideration required for other overlying users

After Katz:
- Introduced the concept of **overlying rights**
- Recognized that overlying users have correlative rights to proportional shares
- Established that groundwater could be appropriated for use outside the basin
- Appropriative rights subordinate to overlying rights

## Overlying Rights

### Definition

Overlying rights are held by landowners whose property lies directly above a groundwater basin. These rights allow the landowner to use groundwater on the overlying land.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Basis** | Land ownership over aquifer |
| **Priority** | All overlying users have equal priority |
| **Use location** | Must be used on overlying land |
| **No permit required** | Automatic with land ownership |
| **Cannot be lost through nonuse** | Rights persist indefinitely |
| **During shortage** | Pro-rata sharing among overlying users |

### Correlative Rights Doctrine

The correlative rights doctrine establishes that:
- Overlying users maintain **equal priority** among themselves
- All must respect others' rights to reasonable and beneficial use
- During scarcity, each reduces pumping proportionally
- Sharing is equitable based on overlying acreage or other methods

### Limitations on Overlying Rights

1. Water must be used on the overlying land (same parcel from extraction)
2. Use must fall within the safe yield of the basin
3. Use must not harm other overlying users
4. All use must be reasonable and beneficial (constitutional requirement)

## Appropriative Groundwater Rights

### Definition

Appropriative groundwater rights allow the use of **surplus groundwater**—water beyond what overlying users need—for use away from the basin.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Basis** | First in time, first in right |
| **Priority** | Based on date of first beneficial use |
| **Use location** | Can be used outside the basin |
| **Permit requirement** | Generally no permit required (pre-SGMA) |
| **During shortage** | Junior appropriators curtailed first |
| **Subordinate to** | Always subordinate to overlying rights |

### Surplus Water Requirement

Appropriative rights assume surplus water exists:
- If overlying users consume water at or near safe yield, no surplus exists
- No appropriative right to additional water can be established
- Appropriators must yield to overlying users' reasonable needs

### Typical Appropriators

- Municipal water supplies
- Agricultural districts
- Industrial users
- Entities extracting distant from service areas

## Prescriptive Rights

### Definition

Prescriptive rights are acquired through **unauthorized taking of water** that continues long enough to create a vested legal interest.

### Requirements (5-Year Rule)

To establish prescriptive groundwater rights, pumping must be:
1. **Actual** - Real extraction, not theoretical
2. **Open and notorious** - Not hidden from other users
3. **Hostile** - Adverse to overlying users' interests
4. **Continuous and uninterrupted** - For at least five consecutive years
5. **Under claim of right** - Asserted as a legal entitlement

### Priority Considerations

- Prescriptive rights hold priority over junior appropriators
- May be subordinate to overlying rights (courts apply equitable principles)
- **Mutual prescription doctrine**: In some adjudicated basins, allocations based on historical pumping patterns

## Adjudicated Basins

### Definition

An adjudicated basin is a geographic area where a **court has issued a final decree** determining all groundwater rights within that basin.

### Purpose of Adjudication

When water users dispute groundwater rights, courts can:
- Determine who holds what rights
- Establish quantitative extraction amounts for each rights holder
- Create administrative structure for ongoing management
- Appoint a **watermaster** to administer the decree

### Watermaster Functions

- Monitor water extraction
- Manage allocations per court decree
- Report periodically to the court
- Ensure compliance with the decree

### Status Before SGMA

- **27 groundwater areas** were adjudicated by 2014 (mostly Southern California)
- Two additional adjudications submitted since SGMA
- Several ongoing adjudication proceedings

### SGMA Treatment of Adjudicated Basins

- Exempt from certain SGMA requirements
- Subject to specific reporting requirements to DWR
- Must report on annual conditions, extractions, and management

## Limitations of Pre-SGMA Framework

### Problems with Unregulated Groundwater

Before SGMA (2014), California faced significant groundwater challenges:

1. **Chronic overdraft** - Extraction exceeding recharge
2. **Declining groundwater levels** - Deepening wells, dry domestic wells
3. **Land subsidence** - Permanent ground sinking in San Joaquin Valley
4. **Seawater intrusion** - Coastal aquifer contamination
5. **Water quality degradation** - Agricultural and industrial contamination
6. **Legal uncertainty** - Overlapping and conflicting rights claims

### Why Adjudication Was Insufficient

- Proceedings take **years to resolve**
- Cost **millions of dollars** in legal fees
- Only practical for contested basins
- Left most of California's basins unmanaged

### The Need for SGMA

- No comprehensive statewide monitoring
- No coordination across basin boundaries
- Individual rights system couldn't address basin-wide sustainability
- Commons problem: Individual extractors had no incentive to limit use for collective benefit

## Groundwater Rights Hierarchy Summary

| Priority Level | Rights Type | Characteristics |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 (Highest) | Overlying | Correlative, on-parcel use, cannot be lost |
| 2 | Pre-SGMA Appropriative | First in time priority, can use off-site |
| 3 | Prescriptive | Acquired through unauthorized long-term use |
| 4 (Lowest) | Post-SGMA Regulated | Subject to GSA management and GSP limits |
