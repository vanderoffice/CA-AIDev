# Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) Framework

## Legislative History and Purpose

### Enactment

SGMA was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in **September 2014** as a three-bill legislative package:

| Bill | Primary Focus |
|------|---------------|
| **AB 1739** | Framework for local groundwater management, GSA formation, GSP requirements |
| **SB 1168** | Fee authority, extraction measurement, enforcement mechanisms |
| **SB 1319** | Plan components, DWR investigations, sustainability criteria |

### Legislative Intent

SGMA reflects several core principles:

1. **Local primacy**: "Groundwater management in California is best accomplished locally"
2. **State oversight**: Local control operates within state-established goals
3. **Comprehensive planning**: Basin-wide management rather than individual rights focus
4. **Sustainability**: Long-term balance between extraction and recharge

### Key Recognition

SGMA explicitly recognizes that:
- Groundwater provides **more than half** of California's water supply
- Groundwater is essential to the state's economy, food security, and drought resilience
- Groundwater doesn't adhere to property lines—requires basin-wide management
- Individual extractors lack sufficient incentive to limit use for collective benefit

## The Six Undesirable Results

SGMA defines sustainability as managing groundwater without causing any of six **undesirable results**:

### 1. Chronic Lowering of Groundwater Levels

- Persistent decline in groundwater levels over time
- Indicates extraction exceeds recharge
- Threatens long-term water availability
- Damages drinking water wells (especially small domestic wells)

### 2. Reduction of Groundwater Storage

- Significant decline in water volume stored within basin
- Recharge insufficient to maintain storage
- Depletes groundwater reserves
- Cannot maintain current extraction indefinitely

### 3. Seawater Intrusion

- Affects coastal groundwater basins
- Overdraft reduces hydraulic pressure
- Saltwater flows inland into freshwater aquifers
- Often **irreversible** and costly to remediate
- Contaminates water supplies for millions of Californians

### 4. Degraded Water Quality

- Point-source contamination (industrial, storage tanks)
- Non-point source contamination (agricultural chemicals)
- Prevents increases in contaminant concentrations
- Prevents migration of contaminant plumes

### 5. Land Subsidence

- Occurs when water removal causes fine-grained sediments to compact
- Can lower land surface by inches to feet
- **Irreversible** in most cases
- Damages infrastructure: canals, roads, buildings
- Extensive in San Joaquin Valley

### 6. Depletion of Interconnected Surface Waters

- Groundwater and surface water are often connected
- Groundwater discharge maintains stream flows during dry seasons
- Excessive pumping depletes surface flows
- Harms aquatic ecosystems, fisheries, instream uses
- **Most technically challenging** to assess and manage

## Basin Prioritization

### Classification System

SGMA classifies California's **515 groundwater basins** into four priority categories:

| Priority | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **High** | 47 | Critical to regional water supply; documented overdraft/subsidence |
| **Medium** | 47 | Important to region; less severe challenges |
| **Low** | ~421 | Minimal groundwater dependence |
| **Very Low** | Combined with Low | Minimal documented problems |

### Prioritization Factors (Water Code Section 10933(b))

1. Population
2. Rate of population growth
3. Number of public supply wells
4. Total number of wells
5. Total irrigated acreage
6. Degree of reliance on groundwater as primary source
7. Documented impacts (overdraft, subsidence, intrusion, quality)
8. Adverse impacts on habitats and streamflows

### Why Focus on High/Medium Priority?

The 94 high- and medium-priority basins account for:
- **98%** of California's total groundwater pumping (~20 million acre-feet/year)
- **83%** of state's population (~25 million people)
- **88%** of irrigated acres (~6.7 million acres)

### Critically Overdrafted Basins

Within high/medium priority basins, **21 basins** are designated as **critically overdrafted**:
- Experienced severe groundwater depletion
- Face accelerated compliance timelines
- GSPs due January 31, 2020 (two years earlier than others)
- Must achieve sustainability by January 31, 2040

## Key SGMA Provisions

### Water Rights Preservation

SGMA explicitly states:
- Does **not modify existing water rights**
- Does **not create new water rights**
- Does **not adjudicate or determine** water rights
- GSPs cannot be used to adjudicate rights

**However**: GSAs can regulate, limit, or suspend extraction if necessary to achieve sustainability—implicitly constraining how rights may be exercised.

### Beneficial Uses and Users

GSAs must consider interests of **all beneficial uses and users**:
- Municipal uses
- Agricultural uses
- Industrial uses
- Environmental flows
- Domestic well owners

### Local Control with State Oversight

SGMA balances:
- **Local authority**: GSAs formed and controlled by local agencies
- **State standards**: Must achieve sustainability within specified timeframes
- **State oversight**: DWR reviews GSPs; State Water Board intervenes if needed

### Coordination Requirements

When multiple GSAs manage portions of a basin:
- Must develop coordinated GSPs
- Must establish coordination agreements
- Separate approaches must achieve basin-wide sustainability

## SGMA Timeline Summary

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| September 2014 | SGMA signed into law |
| June 30, 2017 | GSAs must be formed (high/medium priority) |
| January 31, 2020 | GSPs due for critically overdrafted basins |
| January 31, 2022 | GSPs due for other high/medium priority basins |
| January 31, 2040 | Sustainability deadline for critically overdrafted |
| January 31, 2042 | Sustainability deadline for other high/medium |

### Extensions

DWR may grant up to **two five-year extensions** to 2040/2042 deadlines if GSAs demonstrate good cause (e.g., unexpected hydrogeologic complexity).

## Relationship to Existing Water Rights

### Integration Approach

SGMA preserves traditional water rights concepts:
- Overlying rights remain valid
- Appropriative rights maintain priority dates
- Prescriptive rights protected

But subordinates all rights to the requirement that extraction must be managed to achieve **sustainable yields** that avoid undesirable results.

### Practical Tension

GSAs must:
- Respect existing rights (cannot modify them)
- Achieve sustainability (may require limiting extraction)
- Establish equitable allocation mechanisms
- Balance interests of large agricultural appropriators with small domestic well owners
