# SGMA Implementation

## Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs)

### Formation Requirements

GSAs must be formed in all high- and medium-priority basins by June 30, 2017. **Over 260 GSAs** in more than 140 basins were successfully formed by this deadline.

### Who Can Form a GSA

Eligible local agencies include:
- Cities
- Counties
- Water districts
- Other agencies with land-use or water management authority

### Formation Options

| Structure | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Single agency | One local agency manages entire basin |
| Joint Powers Agreement | Multiple agencies combine via JPA |
| Memorandum of Agreement | Coordination agreement between agencies |

### Formation Process

1. Hold public hearing in the county/counties overlying the basin
2. Decide to become or form a GSA
3. Within 30 days, notify DWR with required information
4. Decision effective 90 days after DWR posts notice (unless overlap)

### GSA Powers

GSAs possess extensive authority:
- Develop and implement Groundwater Sustainability Plans
- Establish monitoring networks
- Adopt sustainable management criteria
- Implement projects and management actions
- Enforce GSP compliance
- Regulate, limit, or suspend groundwater extraction
- Own and operate water facilities
- Acquire property or water rights
- Establish fees and charges
- Designate management areas within jurisdiction

## Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSPs)

### Required Components

GSPs must include:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Administrative info** | GSA identification, managed area description |
| **Basin setting** | Geology, hydrogeology, current conditions |
| **Sustainability management criteria** | Goals, thresholds, measurable objectives |
| **Monitoring networks** | How conditions will be tracked |
| **Projects and management actions** | How sustainability will be achieved |
| **Implementation details** | Financing, governance, coordination |

### Basin Setting Elements

**Hydrogeologic Conceptual Model:**
- Three-dimensional aquifer structure
- Aquifer material properties
- Groundwater flow directions and rates
- Surface water-groundwater interactions

**Water Budget:**
- Historical baseline conditions
- All sources of water entering basin (recharge)
- All uses of water (extraction)
- Future projections (climate change, population growth)
- **Sustainable yield** calculation

### Sustainability Management Criteria

For each applicable undesirable result, GSAs must establish:

1. **Sustainability goal**: Qualitative description of desired conditions
2. **Minimum thresholds**: Quantitative values that, if exceeded, may cause undesirable results
3. **Measurable objectives**: Desired conditions to achieve within 20 years

### Projects and Management Actions

Examples include:
- Increased recycled water use
- Stormwater recharge projects
- Groundwater banking
- Demand management/conservation
- Agricultural practice changes
- Land-use modifications
- Streamflow restoration

## DWR's Role in GSP Review

### Evaluation Timeline

DWR evaluates GSPs within **two years** of submission.

### Possible Determinations

| Determination | Meaning | Consequence |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Approved** | Complies with SGMA and regulations | GSA proceeds with implementation |
| **Incomplete** | Serious deficiencies but correctable | GSA has 180 days to resubmit corrections |
| **Inadequate** | Cannot be remedied in 180 days | Referred to State Water Board for intervention |

### DWR Evaluation Focus Areas

- Required elements present and complete
- Technical analyses based on best available science
- Sustainability criteria appropriate and defensible
- Projects and management actions realistic and adequate
- Public participation meaningful
- Coordination with neighboring basins

### Common Deficiencies Found by DWR

- Minimum thresholds not protecting domestic wells
- Inadequate analysis of interconnected surface waters
- Inconsistency among multiple GSAs in same basin
- Insufficient monitoring networks
- Projects and actions not quantified

## State Water Board Intervention

### Triggering Events

State intervention may occur when:
1. Local agencies fail to form GSA by deadline
2. Failure to develop adequate GSP by deadline
3. Failure to implement GSP likely to achieve sustainability
4. GSP fails to protect interconnected surface waters

### Probationary Designation

If triggering conditions occur, State Water Board may designate basin as **probationary** after public hearing.

**Consequences of probationary status:**
- All extractors must report annual extractions
- Extractors must pay fees to State Water Board
- May require meters on wells
- One-year window for GSAs to remedy deficiencies

### Fee Structure (2025)

| Basin Status | Base Fee | Per Acre-Foot Fee |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Probationary | $300/well | $20/AF extracted |
| Unmanaged areas | $300/well | $25/AF extracted |
| With interim plan | $300/well | $35/AF extracted |

### Interim Plans

If GSAs fail to fix deficiencies within allowed time, State Water Board may adopt an **interim plan**:
- Temporary groundwater management plan
- Contains corrective actions and timeline
- Monitoring plan to ensure progress
- State Water Board directly manages basin
- Higher fees to cover state management costs

### Current Intervention Status (2025)

**Probationary basins:**
- Tulare Lake Subbasin (designated April 2024)
- Tule Subbasin (designated September 2024)

**Returned to DWR oversight (improved GSPs):**
- Kaweah Subbasin (December 2025)
- Kern County Subbasin (2025)
- Chowchilla Subbasin (June 2025)

**Still under intervention:**
- Delta-Mendota Subbasin
- Pleasant Valley Subbasin

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Annual Reports

Due **April 1** each year for the prior water year (October 1 - September 30).

**Required content:**
- Groundwater conditions data from monitoring networks
- Assessment relative to sustainability criteria
- Whether undesirable results are occurring
- Implementation status of projects and management actions
- Total water use and surface water supply data

### Periodic Evaluations

Due **every five years** after initial GSP submission.

**Required content:**
- Thorough assessment of GSP performance
- Whether basin is on track for sustainability
- Whether modifications are necessary
- Analysis of unforeseen conditions or new information

### Plan Amendments

If Periodic Evaluation identifies needed changes:
- Follow same public notice and adoption procedures
- Submit to DWR for review
- Accompany with explanation of reasons for amendment

## Current Implementation Status (2025)

### GSP Approvals

| Status | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Approved GSPs | 81 | 71% of statewide groundwater use |
| Alternative GSPs approved | 10 | Including Borrego Springs (Feb 2025) |
| Incomplete (in revision) | 4 | Low/very low priority voluntary |
| Inadequate/Referred to State Board | 4 | Delta-Mendota, Kaweah, Kern, Pleasant Valley |

### Key Challenges Ahead

1. **Implementation of projects**: Capital investment needed at scale
2. **Agricultural practice changes**: Political and economic challenges
3. **Interconnected surface waters**: Technically difficult to assess
4. **Climate change**: Uncertainty in future water availability
5. **2040/2042 deadlines**: 15 years to achieve measurable sustainability
