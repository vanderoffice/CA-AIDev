# Riparian Rights in Modern California

## Current Status of Riparian Rights

### Continuing Validity

Riparian rights remain a fundamental component of California water law:
- Maintain **senior priority** over appropriative rights
- Provide automatic water access to riparian landowners
- Do not require state permits or licenses
- Cannot be lost through nonuse (dormant rights remain valid)

### Dual System Challenges

California's dual water rights system creates ongoing challenges:
- State Water Board cannot directly regulate most riparian rights
- No comprehensive database of riparian rights claims
- Dormant riparian rights create uncertainty for appropriative users
- Senior riparian priority can displace junior appropriators during shortages

## Interaction with Appropriative System

### Priority Hierarchy in Practice

When water is insufficient to satisfy all users:

| Priority | Water Right Type | Curtailment Order |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 (Senior) | Riparian rights | Last to be curtailed |
| 2 | Pre-1914 appropriative | After post-1914 |
| 3 (Junior) | Post-1914 appropriative | First to be curtailed |

### Exceptions to Riparian Priority

In certain circumstances, a pre-1914 appropriative right may be senior to a riparian right:
- If appropriative right was perfected before riparian land was patented
- If appropriative use was established before riparian rights attached
- These situations are uncommon—general rule favors riparian priority

### Dormant Rights Problem

The permanence of riparian rights through nonuse creates significant issues:
- Junior appropriators may develop water supplies assuming dormant rights stay unused
- Dormant rights can be suddenly asserted, forcing junior users to curtail
- Creates uncertainty that discourages water infrastructure investment

## Riparian Rights in Permit Proceedings

### Applications Near Riparian Land

When the State Water Board reviews appropriative permit applications:
- Must consider existing riparian rights in the watershed
- Cannot issue permits that would injure riparian rights
- Must protect riparian owners' reasonable beneficial uses
- Applicants may need to demonstrate unappropriated water exists beyond riparian needs

### Protest Rights

Riparian owners can protest appropriative permit applications if:
- Proposed diversion would reduce water available for riparian use
- New appropriation would affect stream flows to riparian property
- Riparian owner's reasonable needs would be impaired

## Recent Court Decisions

### California Water Curtailment Cases (2022)

The California Court of Appeal ruled:
- State Water Board lacked jurisdiction under Water Code Section 1052(a) to curtail pre-1914 rights based solely on water shortage
- Pre-1914 rights are not "subject to" post-1914 permitting regime
- Decision created gap in Board's enforcement authority

**Impact on riparian rights:**
- Reinforced limits on State Board authority over senior rights
- Created uncertainty about drought management tools
- Prompted legislative responses to clarify Board authority

### Legislative Response: AB 1337

Assembly Bill 1337 (2022) sought to:
- Provide State Water Board explicit authority to curtail all water rights
- Include senior pre-1914 and riparian rights in curtailment orders
- Protect critical environmental and human uses during emergencies

## Practical Implications for Landowners

### For Riparian Property Owners

**Advantages:**
- Automatic water access without permit applications
- Senior priority protects against junior appropriator diversions
- Rights cannot be lost through nonuse
- No annual fees for maintaining rights

**Responsibilities:**
- Must file annual Statement of Water Diversion and Use
- Must use water reasonably and beneficially
- Cannot use water outside the watershed
- Cannot transfer rights separately from land

### Protecting Rights During Property Transactions

When buying riparian property:
- Verify the property actually borders the watercourse
- Check chain of title for any prior severance of water rights
- Confirm no restrictions on water use in deed
- Understand watershed limitations on water use

When selling riparian property:
- Decide whether to transfer riparian rights with the land
- If retaining rights, use explicit reservation language
- Understand that severed rights may be permanently lost

### Subdivision Considerations

Before subdividing riparian property:
- Consult water rights attorney before recording subdivision
- Determine which parcels will retain direct stream contact
- Decide whether to reserve riparian rights for inland parcels
- Use explicit deed language if preserving rights for severed parcels

## Statement of Water Diversion and Use Requirements

### Who Must File

All persons diverting surface water, including:
- Riparian rights holders
- Pre-1914 appropriative rights holders
- Post-1914 permit and license holders
- Any other surface water diverters

### Filing Process

**Annual deadline**: February 1

**Reporting period**: Previous water year (October 1 - September 30)

**Where to file**: State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Water Rights

**Filing method**: Online through ReportingCA system or paper forms

### Required Information

- Type of water right claimed
- Source of water (stream, river, lake name)
- Point of diversion location (latitude/longitude)
- Quantity diverted (monthly and annual totals)
- Purpose of use (domestic, irrigation, etc.)
- Place of use (parcel description)
- Method of diversion

### Penalties for Late Filing

| Action | Penalty |
|--------|---------|
| Failure to file by deadline | $1,000 |
| Continued failure after notice | $500 per day |
| False statements | Additional penalties |

## SB 389 (2023): Enhanced State Authority

### New Investigative Powers

Senate Bill 389 amended Water Code Section 1051 to authorize the State Water Board to:
- Investigate whether any claimed water right is valid
- Issue **information orders** requiring rights holders to provide:
  - Basis for claiming the right
  - Historical diversion and use patterns
  - Documentation supporting the claim
- Make determinations about extent or validity of claims
- Enforce authority against unauthorized diversions

### Motivation for Reform

SB 389 addressed longstanding concerns:
- Lack of oversight over pre-1914 and riparian rights
- Potentially inflated water rights claims
- Inability to verify actual water availability
- Need for better data during drought management

### Impact on Riparian Rights Holders

Riparian rights holders may now:
- Receive information orders from State Water Board
- Be required to document the basis for their claims
- Face scrutiny of historical diversion patterns
- Need to demonstrate validity of riparian status

## Climate Change Considerations

### Shifting Water Availability

Climate change is altering California's hydrology:
- Reduced Sierra Nevada snowpack
- Earlier snowmelt timing
- More frequent and severe droughts
- Greater uncertainty in water supply

### Implications for Riparian Rights

- Fixed geographic basis of riparian rights may become problematic
- Streams may flow intermittently that once flowed year-round
- Watershed boundaries may shift with changing precipitation patterns
- Correlative sharing during shortages may become more common

### Increased Competition

As water becomes scarcer:
- Greater conflict between riparian and appropriative users
- More pressure on dormant riparian rights
- Potential calls for reform of dual rights system
- Increased value of senior water rights
