# Riparian Water Rights Requirements

## The Riparian Parcel Definition

### Three Criteria for Riparian Status

California law establishes three criteria that determine whether land qualifies for riparian water rights:

1. **Contiguity**: The land must be contiguous to or abut the stream (physical boundary touching the watercourse)

2. **Source of Title**: The parcel must be the **smallest parcel held under one title** in the chain of title leading to the current owner

3. **Within Watershed**: The parcel must be within the watershed of the stream from which water is diverted

If a parcel fails any of these criteria, it loses riparian character and the water rights that would otherwise attach.

## The Original Tract Doctrine

### Smallest Parcel Rule

The "original tract doctrine" (also called "source of title rule") determines riparian status based on the chain of title:

- Riparian land is defined as the **smallest parcel** held under one title in the chain of title
- When original riparian land is subdivided, not all resulting parcels retain riparian rights
- Only the smallest parcel(s) maintaining contiguity with the watercourse retain riparian status

### Practical Example

**Original situation:**
- 200-acre parcel borders a stream
- Owner subdivides into four 50-acre parcels
- Only one parcel touches the stream

**Result:**
- The single parcel touching the stream retains riparian rights
- Three inland parcels lose all riparian rights permanently
- Inland parcels can only access water through appropriative rights or water purchases

## Reasonable Use Among Riparians

### Correlative Rights Principle

Riparian rights are **correlative** in nature:
- All riparian owners on the same stream have **coequal rights**
- No date-based hierarchy among riparian users (unlike appropriative rights)
- Rights are not determined by who first began using water
- All riparian owners share the natural flow equitably

### Sharing During Shortages

During drought or water shortage:
- All riparian owners share the shortage among themselves
- No single riparian has priority over others
- Allocation is based on what is **reasonable and equitable** under the circumstances

### Factors in Determining Reasonable Share

What constitutes a reasonable share depends on:
- Amount of water actually required for beneficial use
- Nature and importance of the use
- Amount of water available in the stream
- Alternative water sources available to the riparian owner
- Effects of use on other water users and stream environment

### Priority Among Use Types

When water is scarce, some beneficial uses have higher priority among riparians:

| Priority | Use Type |
|----------|----------|
| Highest | Domestic (drinking, cooking, bathing, sanitation) |
| Lower | Agricultural irrigation |
| Lower | Livestock watering |
| Lower | Industrial uses |
| Lower | Power generation |

**Important**: Even high-priority domestic use must be reasonable in quantity—users cannot waste water simply because domestic uses have priority.

## Limitations on Riparian Rights

### Constitutional Reasonable Use Requirement

Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution establishes that **all water use must be reasonable and beneficial**:

> "The right to water or to the use or flow of water in or from any natural stream or water course in this State is and shall be limited to such water as shall be reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served."

This constitutional provision:
- Applies to all water rights, including riparian
- Is self-executing (no additional legislation required)
- Limits rights to water actually needed for beneficial purposes
- Prohibits waste, unreasonable use, or unreasonable method of use/diversion

### Cannot Transfer Separately from Land

Riparian water rights **cannot be transferred for use on non-riparian land**:
- Cannot be sold separately from the riparian parcel
- Cannot be conveyed to another party for use elsewhere
- Cannot be leased for use on non-riparian property
- Rights remain bound to the land permanently

### Forbearance Agreements (Exception)

Riparian owners can contractually agree **not to exercise** riparian rights:
- Water agencies may compensate riparian owners for non-exercise
- The riparian right itself is retained
- Agreement is temporary—rights can resume when agreement ends
- Common in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta arrangements

### Watershed Use Only

Water diverted under riparian rights:
- Can only be used on land within the same watershed
- Cannot be transported outside the watershed
- Must drain back to the same stream system
- Cannot be used for enterprises in distant locations

## Loss of Riparian Status

### Physical Severance Through Subdivision

Riparian rights are lost when land is subdivided and severed from the watercourse:

**Automatic loss occurs when:**
- Riparian land is subdivided
- Some resulting parcels no longer touch the watercourse
- No explicit reservation of riparian rights was made

**Result:**
- Severed parcels permanently lose riparian status
- Only parcels retaining stream contact keep riparian rights
- Once lost, riparian rights can almost never be restored

### Protecting Rights During Subdivision

To preserve riparian rights in severed parcels:
- Include **explicit language** in deed or subdivision documents
- Specifically reserve or dedicate riparian rights to severed parcels
- Must be done at the time of subdivision
- Without explicit action, severance results in permanent loss

### Explicit Separation by Deed

Riparian rights can also be lost through:
- Explicit language reserving riparian rights to the grantor
- Deed language stating riparian right is "not transferred"
- Any instrument explicitly separating the right from the land

**Once severed, the property becomes non-riparian permanently.**

## Statement of Water Diversion and Use

### Annual Reporting Requirement

All riparian rights holders must file annual reports with the State Water Board:

**Filing deadline**: February 1 each year (for prior water year)

**Required information:**
- Quantity of water diverted each month
- Point of diversion location
- Place of use
- Beneficial purpose of use
- Type of diversion infrastructure

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Failure to file | $1,000 |
| Continued failure | $500/day after notice |

These penalties apply even if the riparian owner is properly exercising valid rights—the penalty is for failure to report, not for illegal diversion.

## Public Trust Limitations

### Public Trust Doctrine

California's public trust doctrine imposes additional limitations on riparian rights:
- State holds navigable waters in trust for the public
- Public trust values include navigation, fisheries, recreation, environmental protection
- All water rights may be subject to review if circumstances warrant

### National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983)

This landmark case established:
- California water law integrates public trust doctrine with water rights systems
- All appropriations, including riparian exercises, may be reviewed
- State may impose limitations to protect public trust values
- Balancing required between water rights holders and public trust interests

### Practical Implications

A riparian rights holder:
- Cannot exercise rights in ways that unnecessarily harm public trust uses
- May face limitations if use diminishes flows needed for fish/wildlife
- Must balance private interest with public trust protection
