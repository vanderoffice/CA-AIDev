# Riparian Water Rights Overview

## Definition and Legal Basis

A **riparian water right** is the right to use water flowing in a watercourse that automatically attaches to the ownership of riparian land—land that borders or abuts a stream, river, lake, or other watercourse.

### Key Legal Characteristics

- **Automatic attachment**: Rights attach by operation of law to parcels bordering water sources
- **No permit required**: Does not require permits, licenses, applications, or government action
- **Land-based**: Rights are tied directly to land ownership, not to actual use
- **Usufructuary**: A use right—the owner possesses a right to use water, not ownership of the water itself
- **Correlative**: All riparian owners on the same stream share coequal rights

### California Water Code Definition (Section 101)

> "Riparian rights in a stream or watercourse attach to, but to no more than so much of the flow thereof as may be required or used consistently with this and the next preceding section, for the purposes for which such lands are, or may be made adaptable, in view of such reasonable and beneficial uses."

## Common Law Origins

### English Common Law Tradition

California adopted common law riparian rights upon achieving statehood in 1850. The English doctrine assigned water use rights to landowners whose properties bordered watercourses.

**English riparian principles:**
- Riparian owner had the right to water flowing past property undiminished in quantity or quality
- Correlative sharing among all landowners with access to the same water source
- Water could be used on the riparian land for domestic and agricultural purposes

### Incompatibility with California's Climate

The English riparian doctrine was fundamentally incompatible with California's Mediterranean climate:

| English Conditions | California Conditions |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Adequate year-round precipitation | Wet winters, arid summers |
| Reliable seasonal flows | Extreme seasonal variation |
| Abundant water for all riparians | Water scarcity in dry months |
| Minimal infrastructure needed | Storage and diversion required |

A riparian owner might have abundant water rights during winter flooding but find those rights valueless during critical summer irrigation season.

## How Riparian Rights Attach to Land

### Automatic Attachment

Riparian water rights arise automatically by virtue of land ownership alone:
- No filing required
- No permit application needed
- No notice posting necessary
- No government approval required

When a person acquires riparian property, the riparian water right transfers automatically with the land unless explicitly reserved or severed.

### Transfer with Property

- Rights are **"part and parcel"** of the land—legally inseparable from the real estate
- Transfer automatically when riparian land changes ownership
- No separate conveyance or documentation required
- Rights remain with the land permanently unless explicitly severed

### No Loss Through Nonuse

Unlike appropriative rights, riparian rights **cannot be lost through nonuse**:
- A riparian owner who doesn't use water for decades retains full rights
- "Dormant" riparian rights can be asserted at any time
- This creates uncertainty for appropriative rights holders who may have developed water supplies assuming dormant rights would remain unused

## Geographic Requirements

### Contiguity Requirement

For riparian rights to attach, land must be **directly contiguous to the watercourse**:
- Parcel must have physical boundary touching the water source
- Land even a small distance from the watercourse is NOT riparian
- Only parcels that physically touch the water source qualify

### Watershed Limitation

Riparian water can only be used on land within the **same watershed** as the water source:
- Water cannot be transported outside the watershed
- Water must drain back to the same stream system
- Ensures downstream users retain access to return flows

### Definition of Watercourse

A watercourse under California law includes:
- Natural or man-made channels for transporting water
- The streambed and banks
- Continuous, intermittent, or ephemeral streams
- Does NOT include "sheet flow" (water spreading without a definite channel)

## Distinction from Appropriative Rights

| Feature | Riparian Rights | Appropriative Rights |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Attachment** | Automatic with land ownership | Requires permit/license (post-1914) |
| **Land requirement** | Must own land bordering watercourse | No land ownership required |
| **Transferability** | Cannot be transferred separately from land | Freely transferable |
| **Place of use** | Limited to riparian parcel and watershed | Can be used anywhere |
| **Priority** | All riparians share equally | First in time, first in right |
| **Loss through nonuse** | Cannot be lost | Can be forfeited after 5+ years nonuse |
| **Storage** | Limited storage rights | Long-term storage allowed |

## Priority in California's Dual System

California maintains a **dual water rights system** where both riparian and appropriative rights coexist. The general priority hierarchy is:

1. **Riparian rights** (highest priority)
2. **Pre-1914 appropriative rights**
3. **Post-1914 appropriative rights** (lowest priority)

### Practical Effect

During water shortages:
- Post-1914 appropriators are curtailed first
- Pre-1914 appropriators are curtailed next
- Riparian users are typically last to be affected
- Riparian users share shortages among themselves (correlative rights)

## The Landmark Case: Lux v. Haggin (1886)

### Background

The California Supreme Court's 1886 decision in **Lux v. Haggin** fundamentally shaped the relationship between riparian and appropriative rights that persists today.

- **Plaintiffs**: Miller and Lux (cattle ranchers with riparian rights)
- **Defendant**: James Ben Ali Haggin (irrigation developer with appropriative rights)
- **Conflict**: Upstream appropriative diversions from Kern River deprived downstream riparian land of water
- **Result**: Nearly 10,000 head of cattle died due to water shortage

### Court's Decision

The California Supreme Court (4-3):
- Upheld validity and primacy of riparian rights
- Recognized both water rights systems as valid
- Determined appropriative rights are **secondary** to riparian rights
- Established the dual system hierarchy still in effect today

### Key Holding

> "The owners of land by or through which a watercourse naturally and usually flows have a right of property in the waters of the stream."

## Modern Administration

### Statement of Water Diversion and Use

All riparian rights holders must now report their water diversions annually:
- **Due date**: February 1 each year
- **Water year**: October 1 - September 30
- **Required information**: Quantity diverted, point of diversion, place of use, beneficial purpose
- **Penalty for non-compliance**: $1,000 plus $500/day after notice from State Water Board

### State Water Board Authority

The State Water Resources Control Board has authority to:
- Investigate whether riparian use is reasonable and beneficial
- Enforce constitutional reasonable use requirements
- Take action against waste or unreasonable use
- Issue information orders under SB 389 (2023) to verify water rights claims
