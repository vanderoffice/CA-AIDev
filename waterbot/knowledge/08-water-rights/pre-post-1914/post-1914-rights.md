# Post-1914 Appropriative Water Rights

## Definition and Legal Basis

Post-1914 appropriative water rights are water rights established **on or after December 19, 1914**—the effective date of the Water Commission Act of 1913. These rights can **only** be created through formal application to the State Water Resources Control Board.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Established** | On or after December 19, 1914 |
| **Creation method** | Formal permit application to State Water Board |
| **State permit** | Required for all new appropriations |
| **Priority** | Based on application filing date |
| **Regulatory oversight** | Comprehensive state regulation |
| **Documentation** | Complete state records |

## The Water Commission Act of 1913

### Legislative Purpose

The Water Commission Act was passed to:
- End extensive litigation over water claims
- Create administrative procedures for allocating water
- Protect municipal water supplies
- Establish a state water commission

### The December 19, 1914 Dividing Line

The Act created a permanent bifurcation:
- **Pre-1914 rights**: Established under prior law, exempt from permitting
- **Post-1914 rights**: Must be obtained through state permit system
- This distinction was never intended to be temporary

### Progressive Era Reform

Governor Hiram Johnson championed the Water Commission Act as part of Progressive era reforms, addressing:
- Reclamation of swampland challenges
- Land monopolization concerns
- Municipal water supply reliability
- Litigation overload in courts

## Permit Application Process

### Filing an Application

To establish a post-1914 right, applicants must file an **Application to Appropriate Water by Permit** including:

| Required Element | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Source of water | Specific river, stream, or lake |
| Point of diversion | Precise location where water taken |
| Place of use | Where water will be utilized |
| Purpose of use | Irrigation, municipal, industrial, etc. |
| Quantity requested | Acre-feet/year and cubic feet/second |
| Project maps | Supporting materials |
| Filing fee | Adjusted periodically |

### Priority Date

The application filing date establishes the **priority date**:
- Applicant who files first has priority over later applicants
- Priority date is critical during shortages
- Filing date locks in priority regardless of when construction completes

### Water Availability Analysis

The application must demonstrate:
- **Unappropriated water exists** in sufficient quantities
- Analysis of stream system water supply
- Subtraction of water committed to senior rights
- Subtraction of environmental/public trust needs
- Demonstration of surplus water available

**For heavily developed streams**: Analysis may show no unappropriated water remains—application cannot be approved.

## Board Findings Required for Permit

Before issuing a permit, the State Water Board must find:

### 1. Water Availability

- Unappropriated water is available to supply the applicant
- Water availability analysis supports the finding
- Supply exists at the requested time and quantity

### 2. Public Interest

The proposed appropriation must be in the public interest. Factors considered:
- Effect on existing water rights holders
- Effect on fish and wildlife
- Effect on navigation and recreation
- Effect on water quality
- Effect on public trust resources
- Project's consistency with water plans and policies

### Environmental Review

Most applications require California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review:
- **Initial Study**: For minor projects
- **Environmental Impact Report**: For projects with significant impacts
- State Water Board serves as Lead Agency
- Mitigation measures may be required

## Permit Terms and Conditions

### Standard Permit Terms

All post-1914 permits include standard terms addressing:

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| **Diversion rate** | Maximum cubic feet per second |
| **Annual volume** | Maximum acre-feet per year |
| **Season** | When diversions may occur |
| **Instream flows** | Minimum flows to protect habitat |
| **Water quality** | Cannot cause quality violations |
| **Reporting** | Annual diversion reports required |
| **Monitoring** | Compliance tracking |

### Site-Specific Conditions

Additional conditions may address:
- Fish screens on intake structures
- Minimum bypass flows at specific locations
- Construction requirements for diversion works
- Environmental mitigation measures
- Coordination with other water users

### Development Schedule

Permits specify construction deadlines:
- **Commencement**: Typically within 2 years of permit issuance
- **Completion**: Specified in permit
- **Beneficial use**: Deadline to put water to use
- **Extensions**: May petition Board for more time

## From Permit to License

### Two-Phase System

The post-1914 system operates in two phases:

**Phase 1: Permit**
- Conditional authorization to develop project
- Authorizes construction of diversion works
- Subject to development schedule
- Not yet a confirmed water right

**Phase 2: License**
- Final confirmation of water right
- Issued after project completion
- Based on actual beneficial use
- Recorded with county recorder
- Effective indefinitely if conditions met

### License Application Process

After completing construction and putting water to beneficial use:
1. Permittee applies for license
2. Division of Water Rights inspects project
3. Board verifies permit compliance
4. Board measures actual water diversions
5. License issued based on **actual beneficial use**

**Important**: License amount may be less than permit amount if full permitted quantity was not beneficially used.

## Regulatory Oversight

### Comprehensive State Authority

Post-1914 rights are subject to extensive regulation:

| Regulatory Power | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Permit conditions** | Board sets terms for all rights |
| **Modification authority** | Board can modify conditions |
| **Change approval** | Board must approve any material changes |
| **Reporting requirements** | Annual reports mandatory |
| **Enforcement** | Board can enforce compliance |
| **Revocation** | Board can revoke for violations |
| **Forfeiture** | Rights can be lost for non-use |

### Changes Require Board Approval

Post-1914 rights holders must obtain Board approval to change:
- **Point of diversion**: Where water is taken
- **Place of use**: Where water is applied
- **Purpose of use**: How water is used

Changes are approved only if:
- No other legal user will be injured
- Change will not unreasonably affect fish, wildlife, or instream uses

### Annual Reporting

All post-1914 rights holders must file annual reports:
- Filed through online CalWATRS system
- Document water diversions and uses
- Provide data for water availability monitoring
- Track compliance with permit terms

### Forfeiture for Non-Use

Post-1914 rights can be **forfeited** if:
- Water not beneficially used for **5 or more consecutive years**
- Water may revert to public
- Available for appropriation by others

**Note**: Board must affirmatively find non-use occurred before declaring forfeiture.

## Curtailment Authority

### Board's Clear Authority

For post-1914 rights, the State Water Board has clear authority to:
- Issue curtailment orders during water shortages
- Restrict diversions based on priority
- Enforce curtailment through penalties
- Implement emergency regulations

### Curtailment Process

When water is scarce:
1. Board conducts water availability assessment
2. Most junior (newest) rights curtailed first
3. Progressively senior rights curtailed as needed
4. Rights holders notified to cease diversions
5. Violations subject to penalties

### Penalties for Violations

Violating curtailment orders can result in:
- Administrative civil liability up to **$1,000/day**
- Additional **$2,500/acre-foot** of water illegally diverted
- Potential permit revocation
