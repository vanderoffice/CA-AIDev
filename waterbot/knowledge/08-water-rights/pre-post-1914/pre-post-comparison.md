# Pre-1914 vs Post-1914 Water Rights Comparison

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Pre-1914 Rights | Post-1914 Rights |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Establishment date** | Before December 19, 1914 | On or after December 19, 1914 |
| **How created** | Posting notice + beneficial use | Formal permit application |
| **State permit required** | No | Yes |
| **Priority basis** | Date of first beneficial use or notice | Application filing date |
| **Documentation** | Historical records, often fragmentary | Complete state records |
| **State Board oversight** | Very limited | Comprehensive |
| **Can be curtailed by Board** | Generally no (see 2022 decision) | Yes |
| **Changes require approval** | No Board approval needed | Board approval required |
| **Annual reporting** | Statement of Diversion required | Full annual reports required |
| **Forfeiture for non-use** | Generally no | Yes (5+ years non-use) |
| **Amount determination** | Historical beneficial use | Permit/license terms |

## Legal Treatment Differences

### Source of Authority

| Aspect | Pre-1914 | Post-1914 |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Legal basis** | Common law, Civil Code 1410-1422 | Water Code Division 2 |
| **Created by** | Individual action | State administrative process |
| **Confirmed by** | Court proceedings (if disputed) | State permit and license |
| **Recorded** | County recorder (historically) | State Water Board files |

### Degree of Regulatory Control

**Pre-1914 Rights:**
- Exist outside Water Code Division 2
- Not "subject to" the permitting framework
- Board cannot regulate exercise (generally)
- Board cannot modify terms
- Board cannot dictate operational details

**Post-1914 Rights:**
- Entirely within Water Code Division 2
- Subject to comprehensive permitting
- Board can impose and modify conditions
- Board can revoke for violations
- Board has continuous supervisory authority

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### State Water Board Authority

| Action | Pre-1914 | Post-1914 |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Issue permits | ❌ Cannot | ✅ Can |
| Determine validity | ✅ Can | ✅ Can |
| Determine scope | ✅ Can | ✅ Can |
| Issue cease and desist orders | ✅ For unauthorized diversions only | ✅ Full authority |
| Curtail for water scarcity | ❌ Generally cannot | ✅ Can |
| Modify conditions | ❌ Cannot | ✅ Can |
| Require change approval | ❌ Cannot | ✅ Can |
| Revoke for violations | ❌ Limited | ✅ Can |
| Enforce annual reporting | ✅ Statement of Diversion | ✅ Full reporting |

### Statutory Adjudication

For both pre-1914 and post-1914 rights:
- Board can conduct statutory adjudication under Water Code section 2500
- Comprehensive basin-wide proceedings
- All rights determined, quantified, and prioritized
- Results in comprehensive decree

## Curtailment Procedures

### During Water Shortages

**Pre-1914 Rights:**
- Board **cannot** curtail under Water Code section 1052(a) alone
- 2022 California Water Curtailment Cases decision confirmed this
- Board may use emergency regulations under section 1058.5
- Board can establish minimum instream flows
- Pre-1914 users limited to water available after environmental flows

**Post-1914 Rights:**
- Board **can** issue curtailment orders
- Curtailment based on priority (newest first)
- Emergency regulations can mandate cutbacks
- Violations subject to significant penalties

### Emergency Drought Authority

During declared drought emergencies:

| Tool | Pre-1914 Application | Post-1914 Application |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Section 1052(a) curtailment | ❌ Not authorized | ✅ Authorized |
| Section 1058.5 emergency regulations | ⚠️ Uncertain (legal theory) | ✅ Authorized |
| Minimum instream flow requirements | ✅ Applies indirectly | ✅ Applies directly |

## The 2022 California Water Curtailment Cases

### Background

During the 2015 drought, the State Water Board:
- Issued curtailment orders to pre-1914 rights holders
- Argued section 1052(a) authorized such curtailment
- Ordered pre-1914 appropriators to cease diversions

### Legal Challenge

Multiple water service providers with pre-1914 rights challenged the orders, arguing:
- Section 1052(a) does not apply to valid pre-1914 rights
- Pre-1914 rights exist outside Water Code Division 2
- Board exceeded its statutory authority

### Court's Holding

The California Court of Appeal held:
- Section 1052(a) addresses "unauthorized diversions"
- Pre-1914 rights were established outside Water Code Division 2
- Pre-1914 rights are **not "subject to" Division 2**
- Diversions under valid pre-1914 rights are **not "unauthorized"**
- Board cannot curtail pre-1914 rights under section 1052(a) alone

### Implications

| Impact Area | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **State enforcement** | Removed key curtailment tool for pre-1914 rights |
| **Drought management** | Board must use alternative mechanisms |
| **Senior rights** | Strengthened protections for pre-1914 holders |
| **Junior rights** | Bear greater burden during shortages |
| **Policy debate** | Reinvigorated calls for water rights reform |

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: Pre-1914 Rights Are "Less Valid"

**Reality**: Pre-1914 rights are the **most senior** class of appropriative rights. They represent historical reliance interests protected by property law principles. They cannot be arbitrarily eliminated.

### Misconception 2: Board Has Full Authority Over Pre-1914 Rights

**Reality**: Board authority over pre-1914 rights is **extremely limited**—confined to determining validity/scope and enforcing against unauthorized diversions. Board cannot regulate, modify, or curtail valid pre-1914 rights based on water scarcity.

### Misconception 3: Pre-1914 Rights Are Undocumented/Easy to Challenge

**Reality**: While documentary evidence can be fragmentary, properly established pre-1914 rights are recognized as valid and are **difficult to challenge**. Once established through competent evidence, the burden falls on those claiming injury.

### Misconception 4: Pre-1914 Rights Block Environmental Protection

**Reality**: Pre-1914 rights remain subject to:
- Constitutional "reasonable and beneficial" use requirement
- Public trust doctrine
- Statutory adjudication proceedings
These mechanisms allow consideration of environmental needs.

### Misconception 5: Pre-1914 Rights Are Immune from All Regulation

**Reality**: Pre-1914 rights are subject to:
- Waste prohibition
- Reasonable use requirement
- Public trust doctrine
- Statutory adjudication
- Statement of Diversion reporting

## Practical Implications

### For Water Users

**Pre-1914 Rights Holders:**
- Greater security during droughts
- Less regulatory burden
- Still must file Statements of Diversion
- Must use water reasonably and beneficially
- May face challenges proving historical use

**Post-1914 Rights Holders:**
- Clear documentation of rights
- More vulnerable to curtailment
- Subject to permit conditions
- Must file comprehensive annual reports
- Can lose rights through non-use

### For Water Managers

**Planning Considerations:**
- Pre-1914 rights limit management flexibility
- Curtailment primarily affects junior rights
- Emergency regulations may be only tool for addressing pre-1914 users
- Statutory adjudication available but complex and expensive

### For Policymakers

**Reform Considerations:**
- 2022 decision clarified limits of Board authority
- Legislative action may be needed to expand curtailment authority
- Balancing property rights with sustainability goals
- Equity concerns between senior and junior users
