# Pre-1914 Appropriative Water Rights

## Definition and Legal Basis

Pre-1914 appropriative water rights are water rights established **before December 19, 1914**—the effective date of the Water Commission Act of 1913. These rights were created under the common law framework that governed California water allocation before the state permitting system existed.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Established** | Before December 19, 1914 |
| **Creation method** | Posting notice and/or beneficial use |
| **State permit** | Not required |
| **Priority** | Among the most senior appropriative rights |
| **Regulatory oversight** | Limited state authority |
| **Documentation** | Often fragmentary historical records |

## Historical Establishment

### The Posting Notice System

Before 1914, appropriative rights could be established through:

1. **Posting notice** at the proposed point of diversion
2. **Recording** a copy of the notice with the county recorder
3. **Commencing beneficial use** of the water

The California Civil Code sections 1410-1422 (enacted 1872) established these procedures.

### If Formalities Not Followed

If procedural formalities were not followed:
- Priority date attached when water was **actually placed to beneficial use**
- Many appropriators simply diverted water and began using it
- Physical works (dams, canals, ditches) served as evidence of appropriation

### Gold Rush Origins

The pre-1914 system evolved from Gold Rush mining practices (1849):
- Miners needed water for hydraulic and placer mining
- "Finders-keepers" approach to water allocation
- Posting notice mimicked staking mining claims
- Created hierarchical priority system

## Five Elements to Establish Pre-1914 Rights

To prove a valid pre-1914 appropriative right, a claimant must demonstrate:

### 1. Notice of Intent to Appropriate

Either:
- **Formal notice**: Filed with county or posted at point of diversion
- **Informal notice**: Visible manifestation of intent (constructing dam, canal, or diversion works)

### 2. Actual Diversion of Water

- Real extraction of water, not merely prospective
- Physical infrastructure to capture and convey water
- Cannot be speculative or theoretical

### 3. Steps Taken Prior to 1914

- Evidence of appropriation activities before December 19, 1914
- Any appropriation beginning after 1914 required Water Commission approval

### 4. Beneficial Use

- Water must be applied to a legitimate beneficial purpose
- Examples: irrigation, domestic use, mining, municipal supply

### 5. Quantification

- Specific amount of water actually diverted and beneficially used
- Amount determined by actual historical use, not by claims

## Quantification and Amount

### Amount Not Fixed by Notice

The amount of a pre-1914 right was **never fixed by the claimed amount** in the original notice. Instead:
- Amount determined by what was **actually beneficially used**
- Right could only be maintained through continuous beneficial use
- Flexible approach reflected 19th-century development realities

### Evidence of Historical Use

Typical evidence includes:
- Acreage records showing lands irrigated before 1914
- Agricultural records (crop types, quantities)
- Testimony about irrigation practices
- Tax records showing irrigation
- Deed language indicating water rights
- Historical photographs

## Documentation and Evidence Requirements

### The Documentation Challenge

Documentary evidence for pre-1914 rights is often:
- **Fragmentary** - incomplete records
- **Inaccessible** - stored in difficult-to-find locations
- **Lost or destroyed** - through institutional deterioration
- **Paper-based** - county recorder files from 150+ years ago

### Types of Acceptable Evidence

Courts accept various forms of evidence:

| Evidence Type | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| **County records** | Filed notices of appropriation |
| **Physical evidence** | Existing diversion structures |
| **Testimony** | Neighbors regarding visible infrastructure |
| **Agricultural records** | Crop production, acreage |
| **Tax records** | Showing irrigated land |
| **Deeds** | Language indicating water rights |
| **Historical photographs** | Infrastructure, irrigated fields |
| **Court decrees** | From adjudication proceedings |

### Burden of Proof

The claimant of a pre-1914 right bears the burden of proving:
- The right exists
- The priority date
- The amount of water actually beneficially used

## Statement of Water Diversion and Use Requirements

### Filing Obligations

Pre-1914 rights holders must file **Statements of Water Diversion and Use** with the State Water Board:

**Initial Statement** includes:
- Claimed basis of right (pre-1914 appropriative)
- Location of diversion (precise coordinates)
- Place of use
- Types of diversion works
- Quantification of diversions
- Water conservation efforts

**Annual Supplemental Statements**:
- Due July 1 each year
- Document diversions during prior water year (October 1 - September 30)
- Monthly breakdown if use varied seasonally

### Important Limitations

Filing a Statement of Water Diversion and Use:
- **Does NOT establish** a water right
- **Does NOT constitute evidence** of a water right
- Creates official records of claimed diversions

### Penalties for Non-Filing

| Violation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Failure to file | Fines from State Water Board |
| Non-filing | Creates problems proving right's existence |
| False statements | Additional penalties |

**Note**: Failure to file does **not** extinguish the pre-1914 right itself.

## State Water Board Limited Jurisdiction

### What the Board Cannot Do

The State Water Board **lacks authority** to:
- Issue permits or licenses for pre-1914 rights
- Regulate the exercise of valid pre-1914 rights
- Unilaterally curtail pre-1914 rights due to water scarcity
- Modify terms of pre-1914 rights
- Dictate how rights may be exercised (except reasonable use)

### What the Board Can Do

The Board **does have authority** to:

1. **Determine validity**: Whether a claimed pre-1914 right is valid
2. **Determine scope**: Maximum amount that can be diverted under the right
3. **Enforce against unauthorized diversions**: Diversions exceeding right's scope
4. **Address unreasonable use**: Enforce constitutional prohibition on waste
5. **Conduct statutory adjudications**: Comprehensive basin-wide proceedings

### Millview Decision (2014)

The Millview County Water District v. State Water Resources Control Board case clarified that:
- "Unauthorized diversion" includes diversion in excess of a valid pre-1914 right's scope
- Board can issue cease and desist orders for excessive diversions
- Board must be able to determine validity to enforce against unauthorized diversions

## Legal Protections for Pre-1914 Rights

### Senior Status

Pre-1914 rights represent the **most senior class** of appropriative rights:
- Priority over all post-1914 appropriative rights
- Entitled to full allocation before junior rights receive water
- Protected by property law principles

### Cannot Be Lost Through Non-Use

Unlike post-1914 rights:
- Pre-1914 rights generally **cannot be forfeited** for non-use
- "Dormant" rights can be asserted at any time
- Important exception: Millview established forfeiture possible if non-use period occurs AND competing claim is asserted

### Constitutional Limitations

Pre-1914 rights remain subject to:
- **Article X, Section 2**: All water use must be reasonable and beneficial
- **Public trust doctrine**: Cannot harm public trust resources
- **Waste prohibition**: Cannot waste water
