# California Water Quality Standards Framework

## Overview

California's water quality standards system serves as the foundational regulatory mechanism for protecting public health, supporting aquatic ecosystems, and enabling beneficial uses of water throughout the state. The framework integrates state authority under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act with federal requirements under the Clean Water Act to provide comprehensive oversight of water quality management.

## Three Essential Components

California's water quality standards consist of three interdependent elements that work together to ensure comprehensive protection of aquatic resources and human health.

### 1. Beneficial Uses

Beneficial uses represent the public and private purposes for which water can be used and protected. California Water Code Section 13050(f) provides the statutory foundation, defining these as uses that "may be protected against water quality degradation."

**Categories of Beneficial Uses:**
- Municipal and domestic supply (MUN)
- Agricultural supply (AGR)
- Industrial service supply (IND)
- Hydropower generation (POW)
- Water contact recreation (REC-1)
- Non-contact recreation (REC-2)
- Commercial and sport fishing (COMM)
- Cold freshwater habitat (COLD)
- Warm freshwater habitat (WARM)
- Wildlife habitat (WILD)
- Rare, threatened, or endangered species (RARE)
- Fish spawning (SPWN)
- Estuarine habitat (EST)
- Marine habitat (MAR)
- Navigation (NAV)
- Groundwater recharge (GWR)

**Tribal Beneficial Uses (Added 2017):**
- Tribal Traditional Culture (CUL)
- Tribal Subsistence Fishing (T-SUB)
- Subsistence Fishing (SUB)

### 2. Water Quality Objectives

Water quality objectives are the limits or levels of water quality constituents established for reasonable protection of beneficial uses. California Water Code Section 13050(h) requires these be established for all waters within Regional Board jurisdictions.

Water quality objectives come in two forms:
- **Numeric objectives**: Specific quantitative thresholds (e.g., pH 6.5-8.5, dissolved oxygen ≥5.0 mg/L)
- **Narrative objectives**: Qualitative descriptions of required conditions (e.g., "free from toxic substances")

### 3. Antidegradation Policy

State Water Board Resolution 68-16 (October 24, 1968) establishes that where existing water quality is higher than necessary to protect designated beneficial uses, that higher quality should be maintained to the maximum extent possible.

**Three-Part Test for Degradation:**
Any proposed degradation of high-quality waters must demonstrate:
1. The degradation will be consistent with maximum benefit to the people of the state
2. Will not unreasonably affect present and anticipated beneficial uses
3. Will not result in water quality less than that prescribed in water quality policies

## Regulatory Structure

### State Water Resources Control Board

Created by the California Legislature in 1967, the State Water Board serves as the principal state agency responsible for water quality protection and water rights allocation.

**Structure:**
- Five full-time salaried Members
- Each fills a different specialty position
- Appointed to four-year terms by the Governor
- Confirmed by the Senate

**Responsibilities:**
- Adopt statewide water quality control plans and policies
- Review and approve Regional Basin Plan amendments
- Oversee triennial review process
- Adopt policies for toxics implementation
- Address emerging water quality issues

### Nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards

California is divided into nine hydrological regions, each with its own Regional Water Quality Control Board:

| Region | Name | Headquarters |
|--------|------|--------------|
| 1 | North Coast | Santa Rosa |
| 2 | San Francisco Bay | Oakland |
| 3 | Central Coast | San Luis Obispo |
| 4 | Los Angeles | Los Angeles |
| 5 | Central Valley | Rancho Cordova |
| 6 | Lahontan | South Lake Tahoe |
| 7 | Colorado River Basin | Palm Desert |
| 8 | Santa Ana | Riverside |
| 9 | San Diego | San Diego |

**Regional Board Structure:**
- Seven part-time Members each
- Appointed by Governor, confirmed by Senate

**Regional Board Responsibilities:**
- Develop and adopt Basin Plans
- Issue NPDES permits
- Develop waste discharge requirements
- Take enforcement action
- Issue water quality certifications
- Conduct water quality monitoring

## Federal Integration

### Clean Water Act Section 303(c)

California's standards must comply with federal requirements:

- States must review water quality standards at least once every three years
- Any revised or new standard requires EPA Administrator approval
- EPA has 60 days to approve standards that meet CWA requirements
- If state standards are inadequate, EPA may promulgate federal standards

### California Toxics Rule (CTR)

Established by EPA in 2000 (40 CFR Section 131.38) after California's criteria for priority toxic pollutants were overturned by state courts in 1994.

**Scope:**
- Numeric criteria for priority toxic pollutants
- Applies to inland surface waters, enclosed bays, and estuaries
- Addresses human health protection and aquatic life
- Includes both acute (CMC) and chronic (CCC) criteria

### State Implementation Policy (SIP)

Adopted February 24, 2005, effective October 23, 2006, the SIP establishes standardized approaches for permitting discharges of toxic pollutants.

**Key Provisions:**
- Procedures for applying CTR and other numeric criteria
- Guidance on mixing zones
- Bioaccumulation standards
- Metals criteria adjustment procedures
- Monitoring and enforcement requirements

## Triennial Review Process

Water quality standards must be reviewed at least once every three years per both federal (CWA Section 303(c)(1)) and state (Water Code Section 13240) requirements.

**Process Steps:**
1. Develop prioritized list of basin planning issues
2. Consider new EPA Section 304(a) recommended criteria
3. Evaluate whether new criteria are necessary
4. Public review and stakeholder comment
5. Formal adoption proceedings
6. EPA approval for federally applicable standards

**Recent Significant Amendments:**
- 2017: Statewide Mercury Provisions with tribal beneficial uses
- 2019: Statewide Bacteria Provisions (E. coli and Enterococci objectives)
- 2020/2021: Aquatic Toxicity Provisions

## Implementation Mechanisms

### Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs)

State-law permits that translate water quality objectives into discharge limitations for point sources. Required for any discharge that could affect water quality.

### NPDES Permits

Federal permits under Clean Water Act that control point source discharges to surface waters. Must be consistent with California water quality standards for EPA approval.

### Water Quality Certifications (Section 401)

Required for projects needing federal permits or licenses. Ensures project consistency with state water quality standards.

### Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)

Required for impaired waterbodies (303(d) listed). Establishes maximum pollutant loading that waters can receive while achieving water quality objectives.
