# Numeric Water Quality Objectives

## Definition

Numeric water quality objectives are specific quantitative thresholds for particular water quality constituents, expressed as concentrations, levels, or percentages. These provide measurable standards against which actual water quality can be assessed.

## pH (Hydrogen Ion Concentration)

pH represents the hydrogen ion concentration and affects the solubility, bioavailability, and toxicity of numerous contaminants.

### General Standards

| Water Type | pH Range | Maximum Change from Ambient |
|------------|----------|---------------------------|
| General (unlisted waters) | 6.5 - 8.5 | N/A |
| Marine (MAR) or Saline (SAL) | Site-specific | 0.2 units |
| Cold Water (COLD) | Site-specific | 0.5 units within range |
| Warm Water (WARM) | Site-specific | 0.5 units within range |

### Why pH Matters

- Affects toxicity and bioavailability of metals and ammonia
- Ammonia virtually non-toxic at pH 7.0, extremely toxic to fish at pH 8.5
- Changes can increase dissolved metal concentrations
- Most natural waters maintain pH 6.5-8.5

## Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

Dissolved oxygen is essential for respiration of aquatic organisms. Depression of DO levels can lead to fish kills and anaerobic decomposition.

### Minimum Concentrations by Beneficial Use

| Beneficial Use | Minimum DO | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| WARM (Warm Water Habitat) | 5.0 mg/L | Standard for warm water species |
| MAR (Marine) | 5.0 mg/L | Marine habitat protection |
| SAL (Saline) | 5.0 mg/L | Saline water protection |
| COLD (Cold Water Habitat) | 6.0 mg/L | Salmonid fish require higher DO |
| SPWN (Fish Spawning) | 7.0 mg/L | General spawning protection |
| SPWN (Critical spawning/egg incubation) | 9.0 mg/L | Most stringent requirement |

### Ocean Waters

Dissolved oxygen shall not be depressed more than **10 percent** from natural levels as a result of oxygen-demanding waste discharges.

### Factors Affecting DO

- Water temperature (cooler water holds more oxygen)
- Salinity (fresher water holds more oxygen)
- Organic matter decomposition
- Algal photosynthesis and respiration

## Temperature

Temperature objectives protect aquatic organisms, particularly sensitive cold-water species like salmonids.

### Intrastate Temperature Objectives

| Water Type | Maximum Increase Above Natural |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| COLD waters | 5°F (2.8°C) |
| WARM waters | 5°F (2.8°C) |

**Key Principle**: Natural receiving water temperature shall not be altered unless demonstrated that alteration does not adversely affect beneficial uses.

### Interstate Temperature Objectives (Thermal Plan)

- **Cold Interstate Waters**: Elevated temperature waste discharges prohibited entirely
- **Warm Interstate Waters**: Specific objectives by area
- **Coastal Waters**: Area-specific thermal objectives
- **Enclosed Bays**: Thermal discharge limitations
- **Estuaries**: Temperature protection requirements

## Bacteria (Fecal Indicator Organisms)

Bacteria objectives protect water contact recreation (REC-1 beneficial use) from pathogen exposure. The 2019 ISWEBE Bacteria Provisions establish statewide standards.

### Freshwater Standards (Salinity ≤1 ppt, 95%+ of time)

**E. coli Objectives:**

| Metric | Value | Calculation Method |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Geometric Mean (GM) | 100 CFU/100 mL | Six-week rolling, calculated weekly |
| Statistical Threshold Value (STV) | 320 CFU/100 mL | ≤10% exceedance per calendar month |

### Saltwater Standards (Salinity >1 ppt, >5% of time)

**Enterococci Objectives:**

| Metric | Value | Calculation Method |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Geometric Mean (GM) | 30 CFU/100 mL | Six-week rolling, calculated weekly |
| Statistical Threshold Value (STV) | 110 CFU/100 mL | ≤10% exceedance per calendar month |

### Health Protection Target

These objectives are designed to protect against an estimated illness rate of **32 gastrointestinal illnesses per 1,000 water contact recreators**.

### Testing Methods

- E. coli: EPA Method 1603 or equivalent
- Enterococci: EPA Method 1600 or equivalent

## Mercury

Mercury objectives address bioaccumulation concerns, particularly for fish consumption beneficial uses. The 2017 Mercury Provisions established statewide standards.

### Applicable Waters

Waters with beneficial uses:
- COMM (Commercial fishing)
- CUL (Tribal Traditional Culture)
- T-SUB (Tribal Subsistence Fishing)
- WILD (Wildlife)
- MAR, RARE, WARM, COLD, EST, SAL (Aquatic habitat uses)

### Tissue-Based Standards

The mercury objectives establish fish tissue concentration limits to protect:
- Human health (general population)
- Tribal and subsistence fisher populations (higher consumption rates)
- Wildlife that consume fish

### Implementation

Mercury provisions are implemented through:
- NPDES permits
- Water quality certifications
- Waste discharge requirements
- Waivers of waste discharge requirements

## Ammonia

Ammonia exists in two forms with dramatically different toxicity:
- **Un-ionized ammonia (NH₃)**: Highly toxic to aquatic organisms
- **Ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**: Essentially non-toxic

The proportion depends on pH, temperature, and salinity.

### Freshwater Objectives

| Metric | Un-ionized Ammonia Limit |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Four-day average | 0.035 mg/L |
| One-hour average | 0.233 mg/L |

Note: These are pH and temperature dependent, with more stringent standards when early life stages of fish are present.

### Saltwater Objectives

| Metric | Un-ionized Ammonia Limit |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Four-day average | 0.025 mg/L |
| One-hour average | 0.10 mg/L |

### Additional Requirement

Ammonia shall not be present at levels that, when oxidized to nitrate, pose a threat to groundwater quality.

## Metals

Metal toxicity depends heavily on water chemistry, particularly hardness. The California Toxics Rule (CTR) establishes criteria for priority toxic metals.

### Key Metals with Numeric Criteria

| Metal | Aquatic Life (Freshwater) | Human Health |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Arsenic | Hardness-dependent | 10 µg/L |
| Cadmium | Hardness-dependent | 5 µg/L |
| Chromium (VI) | 11 µg/L | 50 µg/L |
| Copper | Hardness-dependent | 1,300 µg/L |
| Lead | Hardness-dependent | 15 µg/L |
| Mercury | 0.77 µg/L (CMC), 0.05 µg/L (CCC) | 0.05 µg/L |
| Nickel | Hardness-dependent | 100 µg/L |
| Selenium | 5 µg/L (chronic) | 170 µg/L |
| Zinc | Hardness-dependent | 7,400 µg/L |

### Hardness-Dependent Calculations

For metals like copper, lead, cadmium, nickel, and zinc, criteria are calculated using formulas that account for:
- Water hardness (mg/L as CaCO₃)
- Acute vs. chronic exposure
- Freshwater vs. saltwater

### Site-Specific Objectives

The State Water Board is developing methodology for site-specific objectives for copper and zinc using the **Biotic Ligand Model**, which accounts for bioavailability based on:
- pH
- Dissolved organic carbon
- Hardness
- Other water chemistry parameters

## California Toxics Rule (CTR) Parameters

The CTR (40 CFR 131.38) establishes criteria for priority toxic pollutants in California waters.

### Criteria Types

| Type | Abbreviation | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Criterion Maximum Concentration | CMC | Acute toxicity protection |
| Criterion Continuous Concentration | CCC | Chronic toxicity protection |

### Pollutant Categories Covered

1. **Metals**: 13 priority toxic metals
2. **Organics**: Pesticides, solvents, industrial chemicals
3. **Organic Chemicals**: PCBs, PAHs, phthalates
4. **Pesticides**: Aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, etc.

### Implementation

- Applied through NPDES permits
- Mixing zone allowances per SIP
- Bioaccumulation factors considered
