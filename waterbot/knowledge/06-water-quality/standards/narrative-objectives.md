# Narrative Water Quality Objectives

## Definition

Narrative water quality objectives provide general qualitative descriptions of required water quality conditions without specifying exact numeric thresholds. They are particularly valuable when numeric thresholds cannot be readily established due to complexity of contaminant interactions, toxicological variations, or ecosystem-specific conditions.

## General Toxicity Objectives

### Core Narrative Standard

**"All waters shall be maintained free of toxic substances in concentrations that are toxic to, or that produce detrimental physiological responses in human, plant, animal, or aquatic life."**

This objective applies regardless of whether toxicity is caused by:
- A single substance
- The synergistic effect of multiple substances interacting in combination

### Rationale for Narrative Toxicity Standards

- New substances continuously introduced into the environment
- Interactions between substances may produce unexpected toxic effects
- Numeric criteria cannot address all possible toxicity scenarios
- Provides protective coverage beyond reach of specific numeric criteria

### Compliance Determination Methods

Narrative toxicity objectives may be determined through:
- Use of indicator organisms
- Analysis of species diversity and population density
- Toxicity testing (WET tests)
- Biomonitoring methods
- Chemical-specific limits derived from site conditions

## "Free From" Objectives

Many Basin Plans include narrative objectives that waters shall be free from certain conditions:

### Substances Causing Nuisance

Waters shall be free from:
- **Floating materials** - Including solids, liquids, foams, and scum that cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses
- **Suspended materials** - In concentrations that cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses
- **Settable materials** - In concentrations that result in deposition of material causing nuisance or adversely affecting beneficial uses

### Taste and Odor

Waters shall not contain:
- Taste or odor-producing substances in concentrations that cause nuisance, adversely affect beneficial uses, or impart undesirable tastes or odors to fish flesh

### Oil and Grease

Waters shall not contain:
- Oils, greases, waxes, or other materials in concentrations causing a visible film or coating on the water surface or on objects in the water, or that cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses

### Color

Waters shall be free of:
- Discoloration that causes nuisance or adversely affects beneficial uses

### Turbidity

Waters shall be free of:
- Changes in turbidity that cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses

## Biostimulatory Substances (Nutrients)

### Narrative Objective

**"Waters shall not contain biostimulatory substances in concentrations that promote aquatic growths to the extent that such growths cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses."**

### Why Narrative for Nutrients

Numeric nutrient standards are challenging because:
- Nutrient-response relationships are highly site-specific
- Multiple forms of nitrogen and phosphorus exist
- Effects depend on residence time, temperature, light, and other factors
- Algal growth depends on limiting nutrient relationships

### Implementation Approach

- Site-specific numeric targets through TMDLs
- Basin plan amendments for specific waterbodies
- Translation to effluent limits through permitting
- State Board developing statewide nutrient framework

## Temperature Narrative Objectives

### Core Temperature Narrative

**"The natural receiving water temperature of intrastate waters shall not be altered unless it can be demonstrated that such alteration does not adversely affect beneficial uses."**

### "Shall Not Be Altered" Provisions

This narrative is supplemented by numeric maximum increases (5°F), but the narrative captures:
- Prohibition on thermal modifications that impair beneficial uses
- Protection of temperature-sensitive species
- Consideration of cumulative thermal impacts
- Seasonal and diurnal temperature patterns

### Cold Interstate Waters

For designated cold interstate waters, the narrative objective prohibits elevated temperature waste discharges entirely, providing absolute protection.

## Sediment Quality Objectives

### Narrative Standard

Sediment quality shall be maintained such that:
- Benthic communities are not degraded
- Organisms living in or dependent on sediments remain suitable for human consumption

### Application

The Water Quality Control Plan for Enclosed Bays and Estuaries—Part 1 Sediment Quality Objectives protects against:
- Direct exposure of benthic organisms to sediment pollutants
- Human health risks from consuming fish and shellfish containing sediment-derived contaminants
- Bioaccumulation of persistent organic compounds and metals

### Why Narrative for Sediment

- Pollutants accumulate in sediments over long periods
- Bioavailability varies with sediment chemistry
- Multiple pathways for ecological and human exposure
- Numeric criteria for sediment remain challenging to establish

## Radioactivity

### Narrative Objective

**"Radionuclides shall not be present in concentrations which are deleterious to human, plant, animal, or aquatic life, or which result in the accumulation of radionuclides in the food web to an extent which presents a hazard to human, plant, animal, or aquatic life."**

## Special Beneficial Use Protection

### Aesthetic Enjoyment

Waters designated for aesthetic enjoyment shall be protected from conditions that would impair public enjoyment:
- Excessive algal growth
- Discoloration
- Objectionable tastes and odors
- Floating debris

### Recreation

Beyond bacteria standards, recreational waters shall be:
- Safe for water contact activities
- Free from conditions hazardous to public health
- Maintained to support designated recreational activities

### Aquatic Ecosystems

Narrative objectives for ecosystem protection include:
- Maintenance of species diversity
- Protection of population density
- Preservation of ecosystem functions essential for sustainable fisheries and wildlife habitat

### Navigation

Navigable waters shall be protected from:
- Debris that interferes with vessel passage
- Suspended solids that impair navigation
- Materials that pose hazards to vessels

## Implementation: Translating Narrative to Numeric

### Permitting Applications

When applying narrative objectives to permits, Regional Boards may:
1. Derive chemical-specific effluent limitations based on site conditions
2. Establish receiving water limitations and targets
3. Require whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing
4. Impose biomonitoring requirements

### TMDL Development

Narrative objectives are often implemented through Total Maximum Daily Loads:
1. Identify narrative objective being violated
2. Develop numeric targets or indicators
3. Establish pollutant allocations
4. Implement through permits and other controls
5. Monitor for attainment of narrative condition

### Site-Specific Objectives

Regional Boards may develop numeric translations of narrative objectives through:
- Special studies
- Use attainability analyses
- Scientific analysis of local conditions
- Stakeholder processes

## Relationship to Numeric Objectives

### Complementary Function

Narrative and numeric objectives work together:
- Numeric objectives provide specific, measurable thresholds
- Narrative objectives capture conditions that cannot be quantified
- Together they provide comprehensive protection

### Hierarchy

Per the State Policy for Toxicity Provisions:
- Narrative objectives retain full applicability
- Are not superseded by numeric objectives adopted later
- Continue to apply where numeric objectives do not exist or are insufficient

### Gap-Filling Role

Narrative objectives address:
- New or emerging contaminants without numeric criteria
- Complex mixture effects
- Site-specific conditions not captured by numeric standards
- Aesthetic and sensory water quality attributes

## Basin Plan Narrative Examples

### North Coast Region

"Water shall not contain biostimulatory substances in concentrations that promote aquatic growths to the extent that such growths cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses."

### Los Angeles Region

"All waters shall be maintained free of toxic substances in concentrations that are toxic to, or that produce detrimental physiological responses in human, plant, animal, or aquatic life."

### San Diego Region

"Waters shall not contain floating material, including solids, liquids, foams or scum, in concentrations that cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses."

## Compliance Assessment

### Determining Narrative Violations

Assessment may include:
- Visual observations
- Biological surveys
- Comparison to reference conditions
- Public complaints
- Expert judgment

### Enforcement Challenges

Narrative objectives present enforcement considerations:
- Subjectivity in determining violations
- Need for weight-of-evidence approach
- Importance of documenting conditions
- May require translation to numeric limits for enforcement
