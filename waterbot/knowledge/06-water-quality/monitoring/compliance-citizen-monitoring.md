# Compliance and Citizen Monitoring

## NPDES Permit Compliance Monitoring

### Self-Monitoring Requirement

NPDES permits require dischargers to monitor their own effluent and receiving waters.

**Rationale**:
- Dischargers know their operations best
- Real-time awareness of discharge quality
- Immediate response to problems
- Cost-effective compliance verification

### Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs)

Formal reports submitted to document compliance with permit limits.

**Contents**:
- Pollutant concentrations
- Discharge volumes/flows
- Limit exceedances
- Compliance status

**Frequency**: Typically monthly or quarterly, per permit requirements

**Submission**: Electronic via CIWQS (California Integrated Water Quality System)

### Self-Monitoring Reports (SMRs)

Detailed monitoring data submitted per permit schedules.

**May Include**:
- Effluent monitoring results
- Receiving water data
- Biomonitoring/toxicity results
- Special study findings

### Monitoring Parameter Categories

#### Technology-Based Limits
Based on treatment technology capabilities:
- BOD (biochemical oxygen demand)
- TSS (total suspended solids)
- pH
- Oil and grease

#### Water Quality-Based Limits
Derived from water quality objectives:
- Specific pollutants of concern
- Based on Reasonable Potential Analysis
- More stringent than technology-based when needed

### Reasonable Potential Analysis (RPA)

Determines which pollutants need numeric effluent limits.

**Considers**:
- Effluent concentrations
- Ambient water quality
- Dilution factors
- Water quality objectives
- Effluent variability

**Outcome**: If discharge has "reasonable potential" to cause exceedance, numeric limit is required.

## MS4 Stormwater Monitoring

### Municipal Storm Water Requirements

Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s) have distinct monitoring obligations.

### Phase I Permits

Large municipalities (100,000+ population):

**Monitoring Types**:
- Receiving water monitoring
- Outfall monitoring
- Trash monitoring
- Special studies

**Requirements**:
- Storm Water Management Plan
- Pollutant reduction to "maximum extent practicable"
- BMP implementation

### Phase II Small MS4 General Permit

Smaller municipalities and special districts:
- Statewide general permit coverage
- Minimum control measures
- Monitoring and reporting

### Caltrans Stormwater Permit

Statewide permit covering:
- Highway stormwater runoff
- Maintenance facilities
- Construction activities
- TMDL compliance (60+ TMDLs)

### Areas of Special Biological Significance (ASBS)

34 ocean areas with enhanced protection:
- Unique aquatic life
- Stricter discharge prohibitions
- Special monitoring requirements

## Clean Water Team (Citizen Science)

### Program Overview

The Clean Water Team (CWT) is the State Water Board's citizen monitoring program, operating as part of SWAMP.

**Mission**: Build and support watershed stewardship through citizen monitoring to reduce and prevent water pollution.

**History**: Over 20 years of volunteer data collection statewide.

### Participants

A diverse range of organizations engage in citizen monitoring:

| Organization Type | Examples |
|-------------------|----------|
| Nonprofit groups | Watershed councils, environmental orgs |
| Resource Conservation Districts | Local RCDs statewide |
| Educational institutions | Schools, colleges, universities |
| Local government | Cities, counties, special districts |
| Community groups | Neighborhood associations |

### CWT Services

The Clean Water Team provides:

- **Training**: Monitoring techniques and protocols
- **QA/QC Support**: Quality assurance guidance
- **Equipment Loans**: Temporary monitoring equipment
- **Technical Assistance**: Protocol development
- **Communication Support**: Outreach and networking

### Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPPs)

For citizen data to support regulatory decisions, quality assurance is critical.

**QAPP Purpose**:
- Document monitoring procedures
- Establish data quality objectives
- Define QA/QC protocols
- Enable data verification

**QAPP Contents**:
- Project organization
- Data quality objectives
- Sampling procedures
- Analytical methods
- Data management
- QA/QC procedures

### CWT Guidance Compendium

Comprehensive guidance covering:
- Introduction and overview
- Field procedures and sample collection
- Grab samples and water quality measurements
- Stream and watershed measurements
- Geographic information systems
- Quality assurance/quality control
- Data quality management

### Data Quality Levels

| Level | Description | Use |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Screening | Basic protocols, less QA | Education, awareness |
| Intermediate | Standardized methods, documented QA | Trend detection, problem identification |
| Research/Regulatory | Rigorous QA, certified labs | 303(d) listing, regulatory decisions |

### Contributions to State Programs

Citizen monitoring supports:
- 303(d) listing assessments (with appropriate QA)
- Baseline data for restoration projects
- Trend monitoring over time
- Problem identification and source tracking
- Public engagement in water stewardship

**Impact**: Thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars worth of monitoring annually.

## Data Integration for Regulatory Decisions

### 303(d) Listing Support

Monitoring data from all sources informs impaired waters listing:

**Data Sources**:
- SWAMP ambient monitoring
- Permit compliance data (DMRs/SMRs)
- Federal agency monitoring
- Academic research
- Qualified citizen science data

**Requirements**:
- Meet California Listing Policy standards
- Documented QA/QC
- Appropriate methods and detection limits

### TMDL Development Support

Monitoring data essential for:
- Source characterization
- Loading calculations
- Baseline establishment
- Target derivation
- Implementation tracking

### Permit Limit Derivation

Compliance monitoring data informs:
- Reasonable Potential Analysis
- Effluent limit calculations
- Permit modifications
- Variance requests
