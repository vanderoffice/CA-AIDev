# SWAMP and CEDEN

## Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP)

### Overview

SWAMP is California's statewide program for assessing the condition of surface waters and watersheds. Established in 2000 by Assembly Bill 982, SWAMP coordinates comprehensive water quality monitoring across California's diverse aquatic environments.

**Coverage**: Approximately 3,000 lakes, 190,000 miles of rivers, and diverse ecosystems from deserts to temperate rain forests.

### Core Responsibilities

1. **Monitor, assess, and report** on water quality conditions
2. **Establish data quality standards** for consistent statewide application
3. **Identify monitoring needs** for policy and regulatory requirements
4. **Provide data** supporting regulatory decision-making

### Four Statewide Monitoring Programs

#### Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program

Established 2006. Monitors fish and shellfish tissue for contaminants:

- Mercury
- PCBs
- Other persistent toxic substances

**Purpose**: Determine which fish are safe to eat; inform Fish Consumption Advisories.

**Equity Focus**: Recent program realignment (2020) prioritizes:
- Tribal relationships and monitoring needs
- Subsistence fishing communities
- Underrepresented populations

#### Bioassessment Program

Assesses stream and river health through biological indicators:

- **Benthic macroinvertebrates**: Bottom-dwelling invertebrates
- **Algae**: Periphyton communities
- **Physical habitat**: Stream structure and condition

**Key Tool**: California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) - standardized scoring for stream health.

#### Freshwater and Estuarine Harmful Algal Bloom (FHAB) Program

Addresses cyanobacterial (blue-green algae) blooms:

- Health risk assessment
- Monitoring and response coordination
- Research on bloom drivers
- Toxin detection

**Trend**: Blooms increasing in incidence, duration, and toxicity; expanding beyond summer to year-round in some areas.

#### Toxicology and Contaminants Program (SPoT)

Stream Pollution Trends Monitoring Program, established 2008:

**Analyzes sediments for**:
- Metals
- Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
- PCBs
- Legacy pesticides (DDT, chlordane)
- Current use pesticides
- Emerging contaminants (fipronil, PBDEs)

**Toxicity testing** using:
- *Hyalella azteca* (amphipod)
- *Chironomus dilutus* (midge)

**Objectives**:
- Track long-term contaminant trends
- Relate contamination to land use
- Evaluate management effectiveness

### Regional Monitoring Programs

SWAMP supports regional monitoring coordination:
- Sacramento Watershed Coordinated Monitoring
- San Francisco Bay Regional Monitoring Program
- Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring

## California Stream Condition Index (CSCI)

### Purpose

Standardized biological scoring tool for stream health assessment, finalized 2013.

### Methodology

Combines two index types:
- **Multi-metric Index (MMI)**: Measures ecological structure and function
- **Observed/Expected (O/E) Index**: Measures biological completeness

### Scoring Thresholds

| Score | Condition | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| ≥ 0.92 | Likely intact | Reference condition |
| 0.79 - 0.91 | Possibly altered | Some concern |
| 0.63 - 0.78 | Likely altered | Degraded |
| < 0.63 | Very likely altered | Significantly impaired |

### Regulatory Use

- 303(d) listing decisions for benthic impairments
- 305(b) high-quality water identification
- TMDL effectiveness monitoring

## California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN)

### Purpose

Central repository where diverse groups throughout California can find and share water quality information.

**Data Types**:
- Streams, lakes, rivers
- Coastal and ocean environments
- Physical, chemical, biological parameters
- Habitat assessments
- Toxicity results

### Data Standardization

Data submitted to CEDEN must conform to:
- **Standardized templates**: Structured Excel formats
- **Business rules**: Automated quality checks
- **Vocabulary standards**: Consistent terminology
- **Quality assurance**: Documented QA/QC

### Regional Data Centers

| Center | Focus Area |
|--------|------------|
| Moss Landing | Bioassessment statewide |
| SF Estuary Institute | San Francisco Bay-Delta |
| Central Valley RDC | Central Valley region |
| SWAMP IQ | SWAMP data verification |

### Public Access

- Free access to all water quality data
- Online data queries and downloads
- Support for 303(d) and TMDL processes
- Community-accessible information

## Specialized Monitoring Programs

### GAMA (Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment)

Established 2000, expanded by AB 599 (2001).

**Purpose**: Comprehensive groundwater quality assessment for drinking water protection.

**Importance**:
- 36 million Californians use public drinking water
- 2 million rely on private domestic wells
- 9 of 10 public water systems use groundwater

**Partners**:
- State and Regional Water Boards
- Department of Water Resources
- Department of Pesticide Regulation
- USGS and UC researchers
- Local water agencies

### State Water Project Monitoring

DWR has monitored State Water Project water quality since 1968.

**Coverage**: 40+ locations from Feather River to Lake Perris

**Parameters**:
- Chemical water quality
- Physical properties
- Biological indicators

**Goals**:
- Understand spatial/temporal changes
- Plan water treatment
- Respond to emergencies
- Ensure drinking water compatibility
