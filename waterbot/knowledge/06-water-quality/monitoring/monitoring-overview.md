# Water Quality Monitoring Overview

## Purpose of Monitoring

Water quality monitoring serves multiple essential functions in California:

- **Assess conditions**: Characterize water body health and status
- **Detect trends**: Track changes over time
- **Support decisions**: Provide data for regulatory actions
- **Verify compliance**: Confirm permit requirements are met
- **Evaluate effectiveness**: Measure success of pollution controls

## Two Main Types of Monitoring

### Ambient Monitoring

Characterizes overall water body condition independent of specific discharge sources.

**Focus Areas**:
- General water quality parameters
- Biological community health
- Sediment quality
- Fish tissue contamination
- Habitat conditions

**Primary Program**: Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP)

### Compliance Monitoring

Verifies that permitted dischargers meet their permit requirements.

**Focus Areas**:
- Effluent quality
- Discharge volumes
- Pollutant concentrations
- Receiving water impacts

**Primary Mechanism**: NPDES permit self-monitoring and reporting

## Key Monitoring Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Beneficial Use Assessment | Determine if water bodies support designated uses |
| Baseline Establishment | Document current conditions |
| Trend Detection | Identify improving or degrading conditions |
| Source Identification | Locate pollution sources |
| Treatment Evaluation | Assess control measure effectiveness |
| 303(d) Support | Inform impaired waters listing decisions |
| TMDL Development | Provide data for load calculations |

## Monitoring Parameters

### Physical Parameters

- Temperature
- Dissolved oxygen
- pH
- Conductivity
- Turbidity
- Flow/velocity

### Chemical Parameters

- Nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus)
- Metals (mercury, copper, zinc, lead)
- Pesticides
- Organic compounds
- Conventional pollutants

### Biological Parameters

- Benthic macroinvertebrates
- Algae
- Fish tissue contamination
- Toxicity testing
- Habitat assessment

## Data Integration

### California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN)

Central repository aggregating water quality data from:
- State and Regional Water Boards
- SWAMP programs
- Federal agencies (USGS, EPA)
- Local government agencies
- Nonprofit organizations
- Citizen science programs

### California Integrated Water Quality System (CIWQS)

Regulatory data system tracking:
- Permits and orders
- Discharge monitoring reports
- Compliance status
- Violations and enforcement

## Monitoring Programs at a Glance

| Program | Focus | Lead Agency |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| SWAMP | Ambient surface water | State Water Board |
| GAMA | Groundwater | State Water Board |
| SPoT | Sediment trends | State Water Board |
| Clean Water Team | Citizen science | State Water Board |
| NPDES Monitoring | Compliance | Regional Boards |
| SWP Monitoring | State Water Project | DWR |

## Data Use in Regulatory Decisions

Monitoring data directly supports:

### 303(d) Listing

- Assess beneficial use attainment
- Apply California Listing Policy
- Determine impairment status

### TMDL Development

- Source characterization
- Load calculations
- Baseline conditions
- Target setting

### Permit Development

- Reasonable Potential Analysis
- Effluent limit derivation
- Water quality-based limits

### Enforcement

- Violation documentation
- Compliance trending
- Priority setting

## Data Quality Requirements

For data to support regulatory decisions:

- **Standard methods**: Approved analytical procedures
- **QA/QC documentation**: Quality assurance records
- **Detection limits**: Appropriate for standards comparison
- **Chain of custody**: Sample integrity assured
- **Metadata**: Complete sampling information

## California's Data Integration Vision

Open data principles (State Water Board Resolution 2018-0032):

- Accessible data for all stakeholders
- Standardized formats and vocabularies
- Quality-assured and documented
- Transparent methodologies
