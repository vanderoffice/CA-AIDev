# Basin Plan Contents

## Standard Chapter Structure

While specific arrangements vary by region, Basin Plans follow a standardized structure:

## Chapter 1: Introduction

**Purpose and Scope**
- Explanation of Basin Plan purpose
- Legal authority (Porter-Cologne, Clean Water Act)
- Functions of State and Regional Water Boards
- Regional geographic and physical characteristics
- History of basin planning in the region

**Regional Description**
- Hydrologic unit boundaries
- Climate and topography
- Geology and groundwater basins
- Land use patterns
- Population and major industries

## Chapter 2: Beneficial Uses

**Core Content**
- Definitions of all beneficial use categories
- Tables designating uses by waterbody
- Existing uses (attained since November 28, 1975)
- Potential uses (designated for future attainment)

**Use Designation Tables**

Typically organized by:
- Major water bodies (rivers, lakes, bays)
- Hydrologic areas/subareas
- Groundwater basins
- Coastal and ocean waters
- Wetlands

**Standard Beneficial Use Categories**

| Category | Uses |
|----------|------|
| Water Supply | MUN, AGR, IND, PRO, AQUA |
| Groundwater | GWR, FRSH |
| Recreation | REC-1, REC-2 |
| Navigation/Power | NAV, POW |
| Fishing | COMM, SHELL |
| Aquatic Habitat | COLD, WARM, SPWN, MIGR, EST, MAR, SAL, WET |
| Wildlife | WILD |
| Conservation | RARE, BIOL |
| Tribal (2017) | CUL, T-SUB, SUB |

## Chapter 3: Water Quality Objectives

**Numeric Objectives**

Specific quantitative limits for:
- Dissolved oxygen (mg/L)
- pH (range)
- Temperature (°F or °C)
- Bacteria (CFU/100mL)
- Specific chemicals (µg/L or mg/L)
- Turbidity (NTU)
- Salinity/TDS (mg/L)

**Narrative Objectives**

Qualitative requirements such as:
- "Waters shall be free from..."
  - Floating materials causing nuisance
  - Settleable materials in problem concentrations
  - Oil, grease causing visible films
  - Biostimulatory substances promoting excessive growth
  - Toxic substances in harmful concentrations
- "Shall not be altered unless..."
  - Temperature provisions
  - pH change limits

**Site-Specific vs. Regional Objectives**

- Some objectives apply to specific waterbodies
- Others apply region-wide to waters with designated uses
- Tables often organize by beneficial use protected

## Chapter 4: Implementation

**Regulatory Programs**

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| NPDES Permits | Point source discharge controls |
| WDRs | Waste discharge requirements (state permits) |
| Waivers | Conditional waivers for low-threat discharges |
| General Permits | Streamlined permits for categories |
| TMDLs | Impaired water restoration programs |

**Nonpoint Source Programs**
- Agricultural runoff management
- Timber harvest provisions
- Urban stormwater controls
- Construction site management
- Silviculture BMPs

**Water Quality Control Measures**
- Prohibition of certain discharges
- Effluent limitation requirements
- Best management practices
- Compliance schedules
- Monitoring requirements

**Implementation Policies**
- Mixing zone policies
- Compliance determination methods
- Variance procedures
- Exception processes

## Chapter 5: Plans and Policies (or Incorporated Documents)

**State Board Policies Incorporated by Reference**

| Policy | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Resolution 68-16 | Antidegradation Policy |
| Resolution 88-63 | Sources of Drinking Water |
| SIP (2005) | Toxic pollutant implementation |
| Ocean Plan | Coastal water standards |
| Thermal Plan | Temperature standards |
| Tribal Beneficial Uses (2017) | CUL, T-SUB, SUB definitions |

**Additional Plans**
- California Toxics Rule (CTR) criteria
- Priority pollutant objectives
- Mercury Provisions (Part 2)
- Bacteria Provisions

## Chapter 6: Surveillance and Monitoring

**Monitoring Programs**
- Ambient water quality monitoring
- Compliance monitoring (permit-based)
- Special studies
- Trend analysis

**Data Collection**
- Surface water monitoring stations
- Groundwater monitoring wells
- Bioassessment programs
- Fish tissue monitoring

**Reporting Requirements**
- Self-monitoring by dischargers
- Electronic reporting systems (CIWQS)
- Annual reports
- Public access to data

## Chapter 7: TMDLs (in some regions)

**For Impaired Waterbodies**

Each TMDL includes:
- Problem statement
- Numeric targets
- Source analysis
- Loading capacity
- Wasteload allocations (point sources)
- Load allocations (nonpoint sources)
- Margin of safety
- Implementation plan
- Monitoring plan

## Appendices

Common appendices include:
- Detailed beneficial use tables
- Maps of hydrologic areas
- Groundwater basin descriptions
- Historical water quality data
- Technical support documents
- CEQA documentation

## Regional Variations

### Examples of Regional Differences

| Region | Notable Features |
|--------|------------------|
| Region 1 (North Coast) | Extensive tribal consultation; wetland-specific uses (WET, WQE, FLD) |
| Region 4 (Los Angeles) | Detailed urban stormwater provisions; extensive TMDL chapter |
| Region 5 (Central Valley) | Separate Sacramento/San Joaquin sections; agricultural focus |
| Region 6 (Lahontan) | Tahoe-specific provisions; unique high-desert objectives |
| Region 9 (San Diego) | Border watershed considerations; ocean/bay focus |

## How to Use a Basin Plan

### Finding Applicable Standards

1. **Identify the waterbody** (specific name or hydrologic area)
2. **Check Chapter 2** for designated beneficial uses
3. **Check Chapter 3** for applicable water quality objectives
4. **Check Chapter 4** for implementation requirements
5. **Check Chapter 7** (if applicable) for TMDL requirements

### For Permit Writers

Basin Plans drive permit conditions:
- Effluent limits must ensure objectives are met
- All designated uses must be protected
- Antidegradation requirements apply
- TMDLs impose additional limits on impaired waters
