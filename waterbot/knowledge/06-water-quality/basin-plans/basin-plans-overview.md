# Basin Plans Overview

## Definition

**Basin Plans** (formally Water Quality Control Plans) are California's master planning documents that establish water quality standards, beneficial use designations, and implementation programs for each region. They serve as the primary regulatory reference for meeting both state and federal water quality requirements.

## Legal Authority

### Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act

California's primary state authority for water quality control. Key provisions:

- Took effect January 1, 1970
- Requires Regional Boards to formulate and adopt Basin Plans
- Establishes requirement for "highest water quality which is reasonable"
- Authorizes regulation of both surface water AND groundwater
- Covers both point and nonpoint pollution sources

**Advantage over Federal Law**: Porter-Cologne allows California to regulate sources exempted from federal NPDES requirements, including certain nonpoint sources and groundwater discharges.

### Clean Water Act Integration

Basin Plans simultaneously serve federal functions:

| State Function | Federal Equivalent |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Beneficial uses | Designated uses (CWA §303(c)) |
| Water quality objectives | Water quality criteria |
| Resolution 68-16 | Antidegradation policy |

Basin Plan amendments affecting water quality standards require EPA approval in addition to state approval.

## Three Core Components

Every Basin Plan contains three essential elements:

### 1. Beneficial Use Designations

- Define what uses each waterbody must support
- Include 24+ statewide uses plus 3 tribal uses (2017)
- Cannot remove existing uses without Use Attainability Analysis
- Drive all subsequent water quality protection requirements

### 2. Water Quality Objectives

- Numeric limits (concentrations, temperatures, etc.)
- Narrative criteria (qualitative requirements)
- Must reasonably protect all designated beneficial uses
- May be site-specific or apply region-wide

### 3. Implementation Programs

- Specific actions required to achieve objectives
- Identifies responsible parties and timelines
- Regulatory tools (permits, WDRs, TMDLs)
- Voluntary programs and best management practices

## Nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards

California divides water quality management among nine geographic regions reflecting hydrologic basins:

| Region | Name | Key Characteristics |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| **1** | North Coast | Del Norte to Marin; high rainfall, coastal streams |
| **2** | San Francisco Bay | Bay Area; SF Bay estuary, urban watersheds |
| **3** | Central Coast | Santa Cruz to Ventura; coastal agriculture |
| **4** | Los Angeles | LA/Ventura counties; highly urbanized |
| **5** | Central Valley | Sacramento/San Joaquin basins; agriculture |
| **6** | Lahontan | Eastern Sierra, Mono Lake; high desert |
| **7** | Colorado River Basin | SE desert; Imperial Valley, Colorado River |
| **8** | Santa Ana | Inland Empire; Santa Ana River watershed |
| **9** | San Diego | Southern coastal; San Diego to Mexican border |

### Regional Board Structure

Each Regional Board has:
- Semi-autonomous authority within state framework
- Own staff and budget (under State Board coordination)
- Primary responsibility for day-to-day implementation
- Authority to adopt region-specific provisions

## State Water Resources Control Board Role

The State Board provides statewide oversight:

- **Policy Setting**: Adopts statewide plans and policies
- **Coordination**: Supports and coordinates Regional Boards
- **Approval**: Reviews and approves all Basin Plan amendments
- **Appeals**: Reviews petitions contesting Regional Board actions
- **Water Rights**: Dual authority over both water allocation and quality

## Statewide Plans and Policies

The State Board adopts plans that apply across all regions:

| Plan/Policy | Scope |
|-------------|-------|
| Bay-Delta Plan | Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta |
| California Ocean Plan | Ocean waters |
| Thermal Plan | Temperature standards |
| Inland Surface Waters Plan | Part 2: Tribal and mercury provisions |
| State Implementation Policy (SIP) | Toxic pollutant permitting |
| Antidegradation Policy (68-16) | High quality water protection |
| Sources of Drinking Water | MUN designation requirements |

## Basin Plan Portal

The State Water Board maintains a **Basin Plan Portal** for accessing Basin Plans:

- Interactive mapping tool
- Links to all nine regional Basin Plans
- Access to amendments and supporting documents
- URL: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/data_databases/basin_plan_portal.html

## Living Documents

Basin Plans are not static—they're continuously updated through:

- **Triennial Review**: Required every 3 years
- **Amendments**: Formal process for changes
- **TMDLs**: Added for impaired waters
- **New Standards**: As science evolves

Each update goes through public participation, Regional Board adoption, State Board approval, OAL review, and (for water quality standards) EPA approval.

## Key Dates

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1949 | Dickey Act creates 9 Regional Boards |
| 1968 | Resolution 68-16 (Antidegradation) adopted |
| 1970 | Porter-Cologne Act takes effect |
| 1972 | Federal Clean Water Act enacted |
| 1988 | Sources of Drinking Water Policy |
| 2005 | State Implementation Policy (SIP) |
| 2017 | Tribal Beneficial Uses added |
