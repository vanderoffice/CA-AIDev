# Basin Plan Amendment Process

## Overview

Basin Plan amendments are formal changes to water quality control plans. The process involves extensive public participation, technical analysis, and multiple levels of regulatory review.

## Amendment Triggers

Basin Plans may be amended when:

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| New scientific information | Updated toxicity studies |
| Emerging water quality issues | Microplastics, PFAS |
| Changed legal requirements | New federal regulations |
| TMDL development | Impaired water restoration |
| Triennial review findings | Identified gaps or outdated standards |
| Stakeholder requests | Petition for updated objectives |
| Policy updates | State Board adopts new statewide policy |

## Triennial Review Requirement

### Legal Basis

- **Clean Water Act Section 303(c)**: Federal triennial review requirement
- **Water Code Section 13240**: State triennial review requirement

### Purpose

Every three years, Regional Boards must:
1. Evaluate Basin Plan adequacy
2. Assess water quality conditions
3. Consider new scientific information
4. Gather stakeholder input on priorities
5. Develop prioritized list of amendment projects

### Process

1. **Data Collection**: Review monitoring data from previous three years
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate whether standards are being achieved
3. **Input Gathering**: Solicit stakeholder comments on issues
4. **Prioritization**: Rank potential amendments by urgency and resources
5. **Work Plan**: Develop basin planning work plan for next three years

## The Amendment Process

### Step 1: Project Proposal/Request

**Initiation Sources**:
- Regional Board staff identification
- State Board direction
- Stakeholder petition
- TMDL requirements
- Triennial review priorities

**Scoping**:
- Define amendment scope
- Identify affected waterbodies
- Determine stakeholders
- Estimate resources needed

### Step 2: CEQA Scoping

**Certified Regulatory Program**

Basin Plan amendments follow CEQA as a "certified regulatory program" (Resources Code Section 21080.5), meaning:
- Full EIR not required
- Functionally equivalent environmental analysis
- CEQA requirements integrated into basin planning process

**Scoping Meeting**
- Public notice issued
- Scoping meeting held
- Input solicited on:
  - Scope of environmental analysis
  - Issues to be addressed
  - Alternatives to consider

### Step 3: Information Gathering and Draft Development

**Technical Analysis**
- Scientific literature review
- Water quality data analysis
- Source assessment
- Stakeholder consultation
- Economic analysis (where applicable)

**Staff Report Development**
- Technical justification
- Draft Basin Plan language
- Environmental analysis
- Response to scoping comments

### Step 4: Peer Review

**External Scientific Review**

For significant amendments:
- Independent scientific review
- External technical advisory groups
- University or research institution input
- Published study incorporation

### Step 5: Public Review

**45-Day Comment Period**

Required elements:
- Public notice in newspaper(s)
- Electronic posting
- Direct mailing to interested parties
- Minimum 45-day written comment period

**Public Workshops**
- Informational presentation
- Q&A sessions
- Opportunity for informal input
- May be held in multiple locations

**Comment Deadline**
- All written comments compiled
- Staff response to each comment prepared

### Step 6: Regional Board Hearing and Adoption

**Formal Hearing**
- Public notice of hearing date
- Staff presentation
- Public testimony (oral)
- Board deliberation
- Board questions

**Adoption**
- Board votes on adoption
- Resolution documenting decision
- Response to Comments document finalized
- Executive Officer authorized to submit to State Board

### Step 7: State Board → OAL → EPA Approval

**State Water Board Review**

The State Board:
- Reviews for compliance with Water Code Section 13240
- Considers Water Code Section 13241 factors
- May approve, modify, or remand
- Approval by resolution

**Office of Administrative Law (OAL) Review**

OAL reviews for:
- Administrative Procedure Act compliance
- Proper procedures followed
- Adequate public participation
- Legal consistency

**EPA Approval** (for water quality standards)

Required for amendments affecting:
- Designated uses (beneficial uses)
- Water quality criteria (objectives)
- Antidegradation implementation

EPA may:
- Approve as submitted
- Approve with conditions
- Disapprove and require revisions

## Timeline

### Typical Duration

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Scoping and draft development | 6-12 months |
| Public review and comment | 2-3 months |
| Regional Board hearing/adoption | 1-2 months |
| State Board review/approval | 2-4 months |
| OAL review | 1-2 months |
| EPA review (if applicable) | 2-6 months |
| **Total** | **12-24+ months** |

### Effective Dates

- **State law**: Upon OAL approval
- **Federal law**: Upon EPA approval (for WQS elements)

Different elements may have different effective dates.

## Tribal Consultation

### Requirements

For amendments potentially affecting tribal interests:

1. **Early Notification**: Contact tribes at project initiation
2. **Consultation Meetings**: Government-to-government discussion
3. **Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive cultural information
4. **Input Integration**: Incorporate tribal concerns into analysis
5. **Response**: Document how tribal input was addressed

### Tribal Beneficial Uses

Designation of CUL or T-SUB requires:
- Tribe confirmation that designation is appropriate
- Specification of waterbody segment and time period
- Formal tribal request to Regional Board

## Special Considerations

### TMDL Amendments

TMDLs for impaired waters follow similar process but with additional requirements:
- 303(d) listing as impaired
- Loading capacity analysis
- Source identification
- Wasteload and load allocations
- Implementation plan
- Monitoring requirements

### Emergency Amendments

In rare circumstances, expedited amendments may be possible for:
- Urgent public health threats
- Emergency water quality situations
- Court-ordered deadlines

Even expedited amendments require public notice and comment.

## Factors Regional Boards Must Consider

**Water Code Section 13241**

When establishing water quality objectives, Boards must consider:
1. Past, present, and probable future beneficial uses
2. Environmental characteristics of the hydrographic unit
3. Water quality conditions reasonably achievable
4. Economic considerations
5. Need for housing development
6. Need to develop and use recycled water

## Public Participation Opportunities

| Stage | Participation Type |
|-------|-------------------|
| Scoping | Attend scoping meeting; submit scoping comments |
| Draft Review | Submit written comments during 45-day period |
| Workshops | Attend and provide input |
| Hearing | Provide oral testimony; submit written comments |
