# Beneficial Use Categories

California recognizes 24 statewide beneficial uses plus 3 tribal beneficial uses added in 2017. Each carries a standardized abbreviation and definition that applies statewide, though Regional Boards may adopt variations.

## Water Supply Uses

### MUN - Municipal and Domestic Supply

Uses of water for community, military, or individual water supply systems including, but not limited to, drinking water supply.

**Priority**: Highest designated use under California water law (Water Code Section 106)

**Note**: Per Resolution 88-63, all surface and ground waters are considered suitable or potentially suitable for MUN unless they meet specific exceptions.

### AGR - Agricultural Supply

Uses of water for farming, horticulture, or ranching including, but not limited to:
- Irrigation

- Gravel washing
- Fire protection
- Oil well repressurization

### PRO - Industrial Process Supply

Uses of water for industrial activities that depend primarily on water quality, including:
- Process water supply

Uses of water that support habitats necessary for:
- Migration
- Acclimatization between fresh and salt water
- Other temporary activities by aquatic organisms

**Primary Species**: Anadromous fish (salmon, steelhead, striped bass)

### EST - Estuarine Habitat

Uses of water that support estuarine ecosystems including preservation or enhancement of:
- Estuarine habitats
- Vegetation
