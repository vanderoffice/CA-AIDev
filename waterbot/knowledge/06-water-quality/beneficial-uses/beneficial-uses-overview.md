# Beneficial Uses Overview

## Definition

Beneficial uses represent the resources, services, and qualities that the California Water Boards protect for each waterbody. They are the foundation of all water quality standards—water quality objectives exist specifically to protect designated beneficial uses.

## Legal Foundation

### Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act

California Water Code Section 13050(f) defines beneficial uses:

> "Beneficial uses of the waters of the state that may be protected against water quality degradation include, but are not necessarily limited to, domestic, municipal, agricultural, and industrial supply; power generation; recreation; aesthetic enjoyment; navigation; and preservation and enhancement of fish, wildlife, and other aquatic resources or preserves."

### Key Policy Declarations

**Section 13000** declares:
- Water resources shall be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent possible
- Waste and unreasonable use must be prevented
- The quality of all waters shall be protected for use and enjoyment by the people
- Activities affecting water quality shall be regulated to attain the highest reasonable water quality

### Hierarchy of Uses

California law establishes a clear priority:

1. **Highest Use**: Domestic water supply (MUN)
2. **Second Highest**: Irrigation (AGR)

All other uses are considered without explicit statutory ranking.

## Relationship to Federal Law

California's beneficial uses correspond to **designated uses** required under Clean Water Act Section 303(c). The federal law mandates states adopt:
- Designated uses
- Water quality criteria to protect those uses

### Federal "Fishable/Swimmable" Goals

Clean Water Act Section 101(a)(2) establishes national goals that waters should:
- Provide for protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife
- Provide for recreation in and on the water

All surface waters must be designated to support these goals unless a Use Attainability Analysis demonstrates they're unattainable.

## How Beneficial Uses Drive Standards

The regulatory relationship flows in one direction:

```
Beneficial Uses → Water Quality Objectives → Permits & Requirements
```

1. **Beneficial uses** define what must be protected
2. **Water quality objectives** (numeric and narrative) establish the standards needed for protection
3. **Implementation measures** (permits, WDRs, TMDLs) enforce those standards

## Existing vs. Potential Uses

### Existing Uses

**Definition**: Uses that have been attained in a waterbody on or after **November 28, 1975** (the effective date of Clean Water Act amendments).

**Key Protections**:
- Cannot be removed or downgraded
- Only exception: substituting a use requiring more stringent criteria
- If water quality once supported a use that has since degraded, restoration is required

**Evidence of Existing Use**:
- Actual occurrence of use activity
- Water quality sufficient to support the use at any time since 1975

### Potential Uses

**Definition**: Uses designated whether or not they have been attained.

**Reasons for Designation**:
- State Board Sources of Drinking Water Policy (Resolution 88-63)
- Plans exist for future use
- Potential exists for future use
- Regional Board designates as water quality goal
- Public desires future use

**Purpose**: Maintains optionality and drives water quality improvement toward beneficial use attainment.

## The Tributary Rule

**Principle**: The beneficial uses of any specifically identified waterbody generally apply to all its tributaries.

### How It Works

- Smaller tributaries and unnamed streams automatically receive the same beneficial uses as receiving waters
- Upstream waters must maintain quality and conditions necessary to support downstream uses
- Creates integrated watershed-scale protection

### Practical Consequences

- Dischargers to tributaries must not impair downstream beneficial uses
- A tributary to a cold water fishery must protect that fishery downstream, even if the tributary itself doesn't support cold water fish
- Water rights permits must include conditions protecting downstream beneficial uses

## Sources of Drinking Water Policy

**State Water Board Resolution 88-63** requires that all surface and ground waters be considered suitable or potentially suitable for MUN designation.

### Exceptions (waters that may NOT be designated MUN)

| Exception | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Total Dissolved Solids | >3,000 mg/L |
| Contamination | Cannot be reasonably treated for domestic use |
| Yield | Insufficient for single well producing 200 gpd |
| Modified Waters | Designed for wastewater or agricultural drainage |

## Protection Throughout the Year

Intermittent streams and seasonal waters maintain beneficial use protection year-round, even when not flowing. During dry periods:
- Shallow groundwater or pools may support wildlife habitat
- Seasonal uses must be protected when water is present
- Designated uses apply regardless of flow conditions

## The Three-Part Water Quality Standards Framework

Beneficial uses are Component 1 of California's water quality standards:

1. **Designated beneficial uses** (this document)
2. **Water quality objectives** to protect those uses
3. **Antidegradation policy** (Resolution 68-16)
4. **General policies** for application and implementation

## Regional Implementation

### Nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards

Each Regional Board develops its own Basin Plan containing:
- Beneficial use definitions and designations (Chapter 2)
- Water quality objectives (Chapter 3)
- Implementation plans and policies (Chapter 4)
- Monitoring and surveillance methods (Chapter 5)

### Regional Variations

Individual Regional Boards may:
- Adopt variations on statewide beneficial uses
- Establish additional beneficial uses specific to their region
- Account for unique local conditions
