# Beneficial Use Designation Process

## Overview

The designation of beneficial uses involves determining which uses apply to specific waterbodies, classifying them as existing or potential, and potentially modifying them through structured analytical processes. This process is governed by both state (Porter-Cologne) and federal (Clean Water Act) requirements.

## Existing Use Determination

### The November 28, 1975 Baseline

**Existing uses** are beneficial uses that have been attained in a waterbody on or after **November 28, 1975**—the effective date of the Clean Water Act amendments.

### Evidence of Existing Use

A use is considered existing if either:
1. **Actual occurrence** of the use activity has happened since 1975
2. **Water quality sufficient** to support the use has been achieved at any time since 1975

### Examples

| Evidence | Conclusion |
|----------|------------|
| Coldwater fish documented in 1985 | COLD is existing use |
| Water used for drinking supply in 1990 | MUN is existing use |
| Water quality met swimming standards in 1980, degraded since | REC-1 is existing use; restoration required |

### Protection of Existing Uses

**Cannot be removed** except when substituting a use requiring more stringent criteria.

**If degradation occurred**: Restoration to previously attained level is required, not acceptance of permanent degradation.

## Potential Use Designation

### Definition

Potential uses are designated whether or not they have been attained on a waterbody.

### Bases for Designation

| Basis | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Sources of Drinking Water Policy | Resolution 88-63 requires MUN designation for most waters |
| Future plans | Plans exist to put water to future use |
| Future potential | Potential exists for future use |
| Regional goals | Regional Board designates as water quality goal |
| Public interest | Public desires to put water to future use |

### Regulatory Effect

- All water quality objectives must protect both existing AND potential uses
- When current quality doesn't support a potential use, improvement becomes a management goal
- Discharge permits may be conditioned to move toward potential use attainment

## The Tributary Rule

### Principle

The beneficial uses of any specifically identified waterbody generally apply to all its tributaries.

### Automatic Designation

Smaller tributaries and unnamed streams not specifically listed in Basin Plan tables automatically receive:
- Same beneficial uses as streams, lakes, or reservoirs to which they are tributary
- Full protection requirements without individual listing

### Practical Application

| Situation | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tributary to cold water fishery | Must protect cold water fishery downstream |
| Discharge to unnamed stream | Must not impair beneficial uses of receiving water |
| Water rights on tributary | Must include conditions protecting downstream uses |

## Use Attainability Analysis (UAA)

### Definition

A structured scientific assessment of factors affecting attainment of uses specified in Clean Water Act Section 101(a)(2) (fishable/swimmable goals).

### When Required

| Situation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 303(d) listed waters | Use appears inappropriate or does not exist |
| Subcategory adoption | Less stringent criteria needed |
| Unattainable use | Evidence suggests designated use cannot be achieved |
| Economic impact | Meeting use would cause substantial/widespread impact |

### Legal Authority

40 CFR 131.10(g) permits states to:
- Remove a designated use that is not an existing use
- Establish subcategories requiring less stringent criteria

But only after demonstrating non-feasibility through UAA.

## The Six UAA Factors

Federal regulations (40 CFR 131.10) establish six factors that may justify use modification:

### Factor 1: Natural Pollutant Concentrations

**Applies when**: Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent use attainment.

**Example**: Natural geochemistry causes toxic substances at concentrations precluding use regardless of pollution controls.

### Factor 2: Natural Flow Conditions

**Applies when**: Natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low-flow conditions prevent use attainment.

**Caveat**: Does NOT apply if effluent discharges could provide sufficient volume to enable use without violating water conservation requirements.

### Factor 3: Human-Caused Conditions

**Applies when**: Human-caused conditions or pollution sources prevent use attainment AND either:
- Cannot be remedied, OR
- Would cause more environmental damage to correct than leave in place

### Factor 4: Hydrologic Modifications

**Applies when**: Dams, diversions, or other hydrologic modifications preclude use AND it is not feasible to:
- Restore waterbody to original condition, OR
- Operate modification in way that would attain use

**Example**: Reservoir cannot support uses of original flowing stream.

### Factor 5: Physical Conditions

**Applies when**: Physical conditions unrelated to water quality preclude aquatic life uses:
- Lack of proper substrate
- Lack of cover
- Inadequate flow
- Insufficient depth
- Absence of pools/riffles
- Similar natural features

### Factor 6: Economic Impact

**Applies when**: Controls more stringent than CWA Sections 301(b) and 306 would cause:
- **Substantial** AND
- **Widespread** economic and social impact

**Note**: Both conditions must be met—impacts that are substantial but not widespread, or widespread but not substantial, do not qualify.

## Case Study: LA Region Recreation Use Suspension

### Situation

Certain engineered channels in Los Angeles Region are:
- Straightened and concrete-lined for flood control
- Designed to move stormwater rapidly to ocean
- Unsafe for recreation during high flow conditions

### UAA Findings

1. Recreation is not an existing use (channels modified before 1965)
2. Factor 5 applies: physical characteristics preclude use
3. Use cannot be attained through effluent limits or BMPs

### EPA-Approved Modification

Temporary suspension of REC-1 and REC-2 during and immediately after defined storm events.

**Retained**: Other recreational uses (fishable goals, aesthetic aspects) remain protected.

## Tribal Beneficial Use Designation

### Process Overview

Unlike other beneficial uses, tribal uses (CUL and T-SUB) require:
1. California Native American Tribe confirms designation is appropriate
2. Confirmation specifies waterbody segment and time period
3. Regional Board then designates in Basin Plan

### Tribe-Initiated

- Tribes may submit designation requests at any time
- Multiple Regional Boards conducting tribal outreach
- Process ensures designations reflect actual tribal usage

### Protection Scope

CUL and T-SUB protect:
- Activities specific to Native American culture
- Tribes' historic uses of California waters
- Practices not covered by existing beneficial uses

**Note**: These uses do NOT protect fish populations or aquatic habitats (covered by COLD, WARM, SPWN, MIGR, etc.)

## Triennial Review Process

### Requirement

Both federal (CWA Section 303(c)) and state (Water Code Section 13240) law require periodic review of water quality standards, including beneficial use designations.

### Review Cycle

Every three years, Regional Boards:
1. Evaluate need for modifications
2. Consider new scientific information
3. Assess management priorities
4. Propose Basin Plan amendments

### Amendment Process

1. Regional Board develops proposed amendment
2. Public review and comment
3. Regional Board adoption
4. State Water Board review and approval
5. Office of Administrative Law review
6. EPA approval (for CWA purposes)

## Regional Board Authority

### Each Regional Board May:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Designate uses | Apply statewide definitions to specific waters |
| Adopt variations | Modify definitions for local conditions |
| Create regional uses | Establish beneficial uses unique to the region |
| Conduct UAAs | Evaluate use attainability |
| Amend Basin Plans | Add, modify, or (rarely) remove uses |

### Examples of Regional Variation

| Region | Variation |
|--------|-----------|
| Region 3 (Central Coast) | GWR includes recharge of surface water underflow |
| Region 5 (Central Valley) | SPWN limited to cold water fisheries |
| Region 6 (Lahontan) | IND includes geothermal energy production |
| Region 1 (North Coast) | Added WET, WQE, FLD for wetlands |

## Special Designations

### Intermittent Uses
