# 303(d) Listing Process

## The Five-Category System

California assesses all waterbody segments into five categories based on their ability to support designated beneficial uses.

### Category 1: All Uses Supported

- All designated beneficial uses are met
- No uses are threatened
- Healthiest waterbodies in the system
- Goal state for restoration efforts

### Category 2: Some Uses Assessed, All Supported

- All assessed beneficial uses are supported
- Insufficient data for some uses
- No impairment identified
- May need monitoring to fill data gaps

### Category 3: Insufficient Data (Watch List)

- Available data suggest uses may be threatened
- Insufficient data to make listing decision
- Warrant enhanced monitoring
- Transitional category for precautionary attention

### Category 4: Impaired but TMDL Not Required

Impaired waters where a TMDL is not immediately required:

#### Category 4a: TMDL Exists
- TMDL has been developed and approved by EPA
- Implementation expected to achieve standards
- Tracked for implementation progress

#### Category 4b: Alternative Program
- Another regulatory program addresses impairment
- Expected to achieve standards within reasonable timeframe
- Requires EPA approval of Category 4b Plan
- Examples: NPDES permit requirements, regulatory orders

#### Category 4c: Non-Pollutant Impairment
- Impairment caused by pollution, not a pollutant
- Cannot be addressed by traditional TMDL
- Examples:
  - Flow alteration (dams, diversions)
  - Habitat degradation (channel modification)
  - Hydromodification impacts

### Category 5: THE 303(d) LIST

- At least one beneficial use not supported or threatened
- **TMDL required** to achieve water quality standards
- This is the actual "impaired waters list"
- Triggers legal obligation for restoration

## California's Listing Policy

The Water Quality Control Policy for Developing California's Clean Water Act Section 303(d) List establishes consistent methodologies statewide.

### Eleven Listing Factors

Waters may be listed based on any of these factors:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Numeric objectives - priority pollutants (CTR) |
| 2 | Numeric objectives - conventional pollutants in water |
| 3 | Numeric objectives - bacteria (recreational uses) |
| 4 | Bioaccumulation in aquatic life tissues |
| 5 | Narrative water quality objectives |
| 6 | Water and sediment toxicity |
| 7 | Sediment quality guidelines |
| 8 | Trash, odor, foam, nuisance conditions |
| 9 | Degradation of biological communities |
| 10 | Trends in water quality |
| 11 | Situation-specific weight of evidence |

### Statistical Methodology: Binomial Distribution

California uses binomial distribution analysis to determine exceedances:

#### Key Thresholds
- **3%**: Acceptable exceedance proportion
- **18%**: Unacceptable exceedance proportion

#### How It Works

The test calculates minimum exceedances needed to support listing:

| Sample Size | Exceedances for Listing |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| 10 samples | 3+ exceedances |
| 20 samples | 4+ exceedances |
| 50 samples | 6+ exceedances |
| 100 samples | 9+ exceedances |

This approach:
- Avoids listing from single random exceedances
- Accounts for natural variation
- Provides statistical rigor
- Allows consistent statewide application

### Data Quality Requirements

Data must meet quality standards:
- Quality assurance documentation
- Appropriate methods and detection limits
- Proper sampling protocols
- Chain of custody records

## Listing Process Steps

### 1. Data Solicitation

- State Board solicits data from public
- All readily available data considered
- Deadline established for submissions
- Data compiled from CEDEN, CIWQS, federal sources

### 2. Assessment

Regional Boards assess data against:
- Numeric water quality objectives
- Narrative objectives with interpretation
- Beneficial use protection requirements

### 3. Preliminary Recommendations

- Staff develop listing/delisting recommendations
- Apply binomial or weight-of-evidence methodology
- Document rationale for decisions

### 4. Public Comment

- Draft report released for public review
- Minimum 45-day comment period
- Stakeholder input considered
- Responses to significant comments prepared

### 5. Board Adoption

- Staff report presented to State Water Board
- Board considers recommendations
- Public testimony opportunity
- Adoption by Board resolution

### 6. EPA Submittal and Review

- Integrated Report submitted to EPA
- EPA reviews for CWA compliance
- 30-day approval/disapproval timeline
- EPA may add listings if warranted

## Delisting Requirements

Removing a waterbody from the 303(d) list requires demonstration that:

### Standards Attained

- Water quality meets standards
- Beneficial uses are supported
- Sustained compliance demonstrated

### Higher Data Requirements

- Minimum 26-28 samples typically required
- Longer monitoring period than listing
- Statistical confidence in improvement
- Reflects precautionary principle

### Delisting Pathways

| Pathway | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Standards met | Data shows compliance |
| TMDL implemented | Category 4a with success |
| Error correction | Original listing was erroneous |
| Standards changed | New objectives are met |
| Pollution source eliminated | Cause of impairment removed |

## Recent Controversies

### 2024 EPA Partial Disapproval

EPA identified 53 waterbody-pollutant combinations California should have listed:

**Benthic Community Effects (44 waters)**
- California placed in Category 3
- EPA contends Category 5 appropriate
- Disagreement over CSCI (California Stream Condition Index) use
- Complex multi-stressor impairments

**Category 4b Disputes (9 waters)**
- California claimed alternative programs address impairment
- EPA found programs not adequate or approved
- Reclassification to Category 5 recommended

### Underlying Issues

- Benthic impairments are multi-stressor
- Traditional single-pollutant TMDLs may not fit
- Resource constraints affect listing decisions
- Federal-state tension on interpretation

## Priority Ranking After Listing

Once listed, waterbodies are ranked for TMDL development:

### Prioritization Factors

- Severity of impairment
- Sensitivity of beneficial uses
- Availability of data
- Implementation feasibility
- Regional Board capacity
- Stakeholder interest

### Restoration Planning Options

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| TMDL | Full load allocation process |
| Advanced Restoration Plan (ARP) | Near-term aggressive action |
| Category 4b Plan | Alternative regulatory program |
