| Herbicides | Glyphosate, atrazine | Agricultural |

**2024 Report**: Pesticides accounted for significant new listings in agricultural regions.

**Sources**:
- Agricultural application
- Urban pest control
- Stormwater runoff
- Residential use
- Historic agricultural use (legacy)

**Example Listings**:
- Santa Maria River Watershed
- Lower Salinas River
- Pajaro River
- Newport Bay/San Diego Creek
- Central Valley agricultural drains

### Nutrients

**Pollutants**: Nitrogen (nitrate, ammonia) and phosphorus.

**Impacts**:
- Eutrophication (excess algae growth)
- Harmful algal blooms (HABs)
- Low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia)
- Fish kills
- Impaired recreation

**Sources**:
- Agricultural fertilizers
- Wastewater treatment plant discharge
- Septic systems
- Urban runoff (fertilizers, pet waste)
- Atmospheric deposition

**Example Listings**:
- Newport Bay and San Diego Creek
- Lake Elsinore
- Canyon Lake
- Malibu Creek
- Big Bear Lake
- Los Osos Creek

### Metals (Non-Mercury)

**Common Metals**:
- Copper
- Zinc
- Lead
- Cadmium
- Selenium

**Sources**:

| Metal | Primary Sources |
|-------|-----------------|
| Copper | Marine antifouling paint, brake pads, plumbing |
| Zinc | Tire wear, galvanized materials, mining |
| Lead | Legacy paint, industrial, mining |
| Cadmium | Industrial, batteries |
| Selenium | Natural soils, agricultural drainage |

**Example Listings**:
- Marina del Rey Harbor (copper, zinc)
- San Gabriel River (copper, zinc)
- Upper Sacramento River (cadmium, copper, zinc)
- Calleguas Creek (selenium)
- San Diego Creek (selenium)

### Sediment and Siltation

**Issues**:
- Excessive suspended sediment (turbidity)
- Bottom sediment smothering habitat
- Sediments carrying attached contaminants
- Impaired spawning habitat

**Sources**:
- Erosion from disturbed lands
- Construction sites
- Timber harvest operations
- Road maintenance
- Agricultural practices
- Channel modification

**Example Listings**:
- Napa River
- Lagunitas Creek Watershed
- Pescadero-Butano Watershed
- Los Peñasquitos Lagoon
- Tijuana River

### Trash

**Definition**: Anthropogenic debris visible in water column.

**Impacts**:
- Aesthetic degradation
- Wildlife entanglement and ingestion
- Microplastics generation
- Impaired recreation

**Sources**:
- Urban stormwater runoff
- Illegal dumping
- Homeless encampments
- Litter from commercial areas
- Industrial sites

**Example Listings**:
- Santa Monica Bay Watershed
- Los Angeles River Watershed
- Ballona Creek Watershed
- Malibu Creek
- Ventura River

### Dissolved Oxygen

**Issue**: Low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) from organic decomposition or stratification.

**Causes**:
- Nutrient-driven algae blooms (decomposition)
- Organic enrichment from wastewater
- Impoundments creating stratification
- Low flows reducing reaeration
- Temperature increases

**Impacts**:
- Fish kills
- Loss of sensitive aquatic species
- Impaired habitat
- Odor issues

**Example Listings**:
- San Joaquin River
- Stockton Ship Channel
- Suisun Marsh
- Chorro Creek

### Temperature

**Issue**: Elevated water temperatures impairing cold water habitat.

**Causes**:
- Loss of riparian shade
- Impoundments
- Climate change
- Reduced flows
- Urban heat island effects

**Impacts**:
- Cold water fish (trout, salmon) stress
- Reduced dissolved oxygen capacity
- Altered aquatic community
- Migration barriers

**Example Listings**: Numerous North Coast streams critical for salmonids.

### PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)

**Status**: Legacy contaminant—manufacture banned in 1979.

**Persistence**: Extremely stable, remains in sediments and fish tissue.

**Sources**:
- Historic industrial use (transformers, capacitors)
- Contaminated sediments
- Atmospheric deposition

**Example Listings**:
- San Francisco Bay
- Newport Bay
- San Diego Bay

### Other Contaminants

**Emerging Concerns**:
