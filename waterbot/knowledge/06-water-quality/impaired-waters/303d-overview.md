# Section 303(d) Impaired Waters List Overview

## What is the 303(d) List?

The 303(d) list is an inventory of water bodies that do not meet water quality standards. Named after Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, it identifies waters where pollution controls have not been sufficient to achieve water quality standards.

As of the 2024 Integrated Report, California has **5,742 waterbody-pollutant combinations** on the 303(d) list—one of the most comprehensive assessments in the nation.

## Legal Basis

### Federal Requirements

- **Clean Water Act Section 303(d)**: Requires states to identify "water quality-limited segments" not meeting standards
- **40 CFR 130.7**: Federal regulations specifying listing procedures and requirements
- States must submit lists to EPA for approval
- EPA can add waters if states fail to identify impaired segments

### Key Definitions

- **Water Quality-Limited Segment**: A water body not meeting or not expected to meet water quality standards
- **Impaired Water**: Water quality does not meet applicable standards
- **Threatened Water**: Water quality not expected to meet standards in the future

## California's Integrated Report

California combines two federal reporting requirements into one document:

| Federal Requirement | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| Section 303(d) | List of impaired waters |
| Section 305(b) | General water quality condition report |

The **California Integrated Report** satisfies both requirements biennially.

## Biennial Assessment Cycle

### Submission Schedule

- Reports due to EPA on April 1 of even-numbered years
- California has submitted 303(d)/305(b) reports since 1976
- All historical reports available through State Water Board

### On-Cycle / Off-Cycle Rotation

California's nine Regional Water Boards operate on a 6-year rotation:

- **3 regions assessed each cycle** (on-cycle)
- Remaining 6 regions are off-cycle
- Each region fully assessed every 6 years

#### 2024 Cycle Regions

**On-Cycle:**
- San Francisco Bay Region
- Los Angeles Region
- Santa Ana Region

**Off-Cycle (with assessments):**
- Central Valley (Sacramento River sub-area)
- Central Coast
- San Diego

**Off-Cycle (no changes):**
- North Coast
- Lahontan
- Colorado River Basin

## State Water Board Administration

Starting with the 2020-2022 cycle, the State Water Board administers the public process for 303(d) listing:

- Coordinates data solicitation
- Manages public comment periods
- Prepares staff reports
- Presents recommendations to State Board

Regional Boards still conduct technical assessments for their jurisdictions.

## Data Sources

Assessments draw from multiple sources:

- **CEDEN**: California Environmental Data Exchange Network
- **CIWQS**: California Integrated Water Quality System
- **Federal Agencies**: USGS, EPA monitoring data
- **Local Programs**: Watershed groups, special districts
- **Tribes**: Tribal environmental departments
- **DPR**: Pesticide monitoring data

### Data Solicitation

- Public solicitation period before each cycle
- Cut-off date established for data submission
- All readily available data must be considered

## EPA Approval Process

### Review Timeline

1. California submits Integrated Report to EPA
2. EPA reviews within 30 days
3. EPA approves, partially approves, or disapproves
4. EPA can add listings the state missed

### 2024 EPA Action

On December 13, 2024, EPA issued a **partial approval/partial disapproval**:

- Approved majority of California's list
- Identified 53 waterbody-pollutant combinations for potential addition
- 44 related to benthic community effects
- 9 related to Category 4a/4b classification disputes

## Relationship to TMDLs

The 303(d) list triggers TMDL requirements:

1. Water body listed on 303(d) (Category 5)
2. State prioritizes for TMDL development
3. TMDL established and approved
4. Water moves to Category 4a
5. Implementation proceeds
6. If standards met, water is delisted

## Priority Ranking

California must establish priorities for TMDL development:

- Severity of pollution
- Sensitivity of beneficial uses
- Available resources
- Implementation feasibility

The Prioritization Framework provides structured approach to restoration planning.
