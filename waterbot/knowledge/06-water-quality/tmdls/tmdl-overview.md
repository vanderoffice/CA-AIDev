# Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) Overview

## What is a TMDL?

A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards. TMDLs are required under Clean Water Act Section 303(d) for water bodies that don't meet standards even after implementing technology-based pollution controls.

TMDLs serve as the critical bridge between water quality standards (what the water body should look like) and implementation (what actions are needed to get there).

## The TMDL Equation

Every TMDL is built on a fundamental equation:

**TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS**

### Wasteload Allocation (WLA)

The portion allocated to point sources—discrete, identifiable pollution sources that discharge through pipes or conveyances:

- Municipal wastewater treatment plants
- Industrial facilities with NPDES permits
- Municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s)
- Caltrans stormwater discharges

WLAs become enforceable through NPDES permit limits.

### Load Allocation (LA)

The portion allocated to nonpoint sources and natural background:

- Agricultural runoff
- Urban stormwater (non-permitted areas)
- Septic systems
- Forestry operations
- Erosion from disturbed lands
- Natural background (uncontrollable sources)

LAs are implemented through voluntary practices, incentive programs, and regulatory requirements for nonpoint sources.

### Margin of Safety (MOS)

Accounts for uncertainty in the analysis. Can be:

- **Explicit**: A specific percentage or quantity set aside (e.g., 10% of loading capacity reserved)
- **Implicit**: Conservative assumptions built into targets and allocations

## Legal Foundation

### Federal Requirements

- **Clean Water Act Section 303(d)**: Requires states to identify impaired waters and develop TMDLs
- **40 CFR 130.7**: Federal regulations governing TMDL development procedures
- States must submit 303(d) lists to EPA every two years
- EPA can develop TMDLs if a state fails to do so

### California Framework

- **Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act**: State authority for water quality protection
- TMDLs are adopted as Basin Plan amendments
- Nine Regional Water Boards develop TMDLs for their jurisdictions
- State Water Board provides statewide oversight and policy guidance

## TMDL Triggers

A TMDL is required when:

1. A water body is listed on the 303(d) impaired waters list
2. The impairment is caused by a specific pollutant (not pollution generally)
3. Existing pollution controls are insufficient to meet water quality standards

One TMDL is developed for each waterbody-pollutant combination. A single water body impaired by multiple pollutants may require multiple TMDLs.

## California's Approach

California integrates TMDLs into the Basin Planning process:

- TMDLs become part of Water Quality Control Plans (Basin Plans)
- Implementation is specified in the TMDL adoption documents
- Phased approach allows for adaptive management
- Numeric targets translate standards into measurable goals

### Phased Implementation

Most California TMDLs use phased implementation:

- **Phase 1**: Initial load reductions and studies
- **Phase 2**: Refined controls based on Phase 1 results
- Review milestones (typically 5-10 years) to assess progress

This adaptive approach acknowledges:
- Scientific uncertainty in predictions
- Long time frames for pollutant reductions to show results
- Need to adjust strategies based on monitoring data

## TMDL Components

A complete California TMDL includes:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Problem Statement | Identifies water body, pollutant, and beneficial use impacts |
| Numeric Targets | Measurable criteria for success |
| Source Analysis | Identifies pollution sources and relative contributions |
| Linkage Analysis | Connects sources to water quality impacts |
| Allocations | Distributes allowable load among sources |
| Implementation Plan | Specifies actions, responsible parties, schedules |
| Monitoring Plan | Tracks progress toward targets |

## Current TMDL Landscape

California has developed TMDLs for hundreds of waterbody-pollutant combinations:

- **Metals**: Mercury, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead
- **Nutrients**: Nitrogen, phosphorus
- **Pathogens**: Bacteria, pathogens
- **Sediment**: Total suspended solids, sedimentation
- **Trash**: Anthropogenic debris
- **Pesticides**: DDT, chlordane, dieldrin, diazinon
- **Temperature**: Elevated water temperatures
- **Dissolved Oxygen**: Low DO conditions
