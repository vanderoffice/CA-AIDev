# TMDL Development Process

## California's Three-Phase Approach

California develops TMDLs through a structured process that ensures scientific rigor and public participation. The process typically takes 4-6 years from initiation to EPA approval.

## Phase 1: Project Plan

The project plan establishes the foundation for TMDL development.

### Required Elements

- **Water Body Identification**: Specific segments, reaches, or areas covered
- **Pollutant Specification**: Exact pollutants causing impairment
- **Beneficial Uses**: Uses being impaired (recreation, aquatic life, drinking water)
- **Scope Definition**: Geographic boundaries and source categories
- **Schedule**: Timeline for completion of each phase
- **Analytical Approach**: Methods for source analysis and modeling

### Purpose

The project plan:
- Communicates the Regional Board's intentions to stakeholders
- Establishes expectations for timeline and process
- Defines the problem to be solved
- Outlines technical approach

## Phase 2: TMDL Project Report and Implementation Plan

The core technical and regulatory documents of the TMDL.

### TMDL Project Report Components

#### Problem Statement
- Description of water quality impairment
- History of water body condition
- Affected beneficial uses
- Geographic scope
- Existing data summary

#### Numeric Targets
Translate water quality standards into measurable goals:

| Standard Type | Target Example |
|---------------|----------------|
| Numeric criteria | 0.2 mg/kg fish tissue mercury |
| Narrative (toxicity) | No toxic effects on aquatic life |
| Narrative (trash) | Zero trash in water column |
| Geometric mean | <126 E. coli/100mL (30-day mean) |

Targets must be:
- Measurable and specific
- Linked to water quality standards
- Achievable through source reductions

#### Source Analysis
Identifies and quantifies pollutant sources:

- **Point Sources**: Wastewater facilities, industrial dischargers, MS4s
- **Nonpoint Sources**: Agriculture, urban runoff, natural background
- **Historical Sources**: Legacy pollution (e.g., mine tailings)

Methods include:
- Discharge monitoring data
- Land use-based loading estimates
- Water quality modeling
- Mass balance calculations

#### Linkage Analysis
Connects sources to water quality impacts:

- How do pollutant loads translate to concentrations?
- What load reductions achieve numeric targets?
- How does the water body process and assimilate pollutants?
- Seasonal and flow variations

#### Allocations
Distributes allowable load among sources:

**Wasteload Allocations (WLA)** for point sources:
- Individual allocations by discharger
- Group allocations by category
- Reserve capacity for future growth

**Load Allocations (LA)** for nonpoint sources:
- By land use category
- By geographic area
- Natural background (uncontrollable)

#### Margin of Safety
Accounts for uncertainty:

- **Explicit**: Reserve percentage (e.g., 10% of loading capacity)
- **Implicit**: Conservative modeling assumptions, protective targets

### Implementation Plan Components

The implementation plan specifies how allocations will be achieved.

#### Actions and Measures
- Specific practices and controls
- Infrastructure requirements
- Best Management Practices (BMPs)
- Treatment technologies

#### Responsible Parties
- Which agencies must act
- Role of regulated dischargers
- Voluntary participant expectations

#### Schedules
- Compliance milestones
- Interim targets
- Final compliance deadlines

#### Monitoring Requirements
- Parameters to measure
- Sampling locations and frequency
- Data reporting procedures

#### Adaptive Management Triggers
- Conditions requiring TMDL revision
- Review intervals (typically 5-10 years)
- Contingency actions if progress stalls

## Phase 3: Basin Plan Amendment

TMDLs become legally binding through the Basin Plan amendment process.

### Staff Report Preparation

Regional Board staff prepare:
- Complete TMDL technical analysis
- Implementation plan
- Responses to stakeholder comments
- Recommended regulatory language

### CEQA Compliance

Environmental review under California Environmental Quality Act:
- **Substitute Environmental Document**: Functional equivalent for Water Board actions
- Environmental impact analysis
- Alternatives assessment
- Mitigation measures

### External Peer Review

For TMDLs requiring significant new science:
- Independent scientific review
- Response to peer review comments
- Incorporation of peer review findings

### Adoption Process

Multi-level review and approval:

#### Regional Water Board
- 45-day minimum public comment period
- Public hearings
- Board vote on adoption
- Findings of fact and resolution

#### State Water Board
- Review for statewide consistency
- Policy alignment verification
- Approval or remand for revisions

#### Office of Administrative Law (OAL)
- Administrative Procedure Act compliance
- Regulatory clarity review
- Legal authority verification

#### U.S. EPA
- Clean Water Act compliance
- Federal regulation consistency
- Final approval or establishment of federal TMDL

### Timeline

| Stage | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Project Plan | 3-6 months |
| Technical Analysis | 12-24 months |
| Draft TMDL/Staff Report | 6-12 months |
| Public Comment/Hearings | 3-6 months |
| Regional Board Adoption | 1-3 months |
| State Board Review | 3-6 months |
| OAL Review | 30 days |
| EPA Approval | 30-90 days |
| **Total** | **4-6 years typical** |

Complex TMDLs may take longer, especially if:
- Significant stakeholder controversy exists
- Additional studies are required
- Revisions are needed after agency review

## Stakeholder Engagement

Public participation throughout the process:

- **Scoping Meetings**: Early input on project plan
- **Technical Advisory Committees**: Ongoing stakeholder input
- **Public Workshops**: Draft TMDL presentation
- **Formal Comment Periods**: Written comments on record
- **Public Hearings**: Testimony before the Board

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Pollutants
- Single TMDL may address related pollutants
- Coordinated implementation for efficiency

### Regional TMDLs
- One TMDL covering multiple water bodies
- Common approach (e.g., LA region bacteria TMDLs)

### Expedited TMDLs
- For simpler impairments
- Streamlined analysis
- Shorter timeline
