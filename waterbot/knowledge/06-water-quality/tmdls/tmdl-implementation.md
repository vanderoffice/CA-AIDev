# TMDL Implementation

## Implementation Pathways

TMDL implementation differs fundamentally between point sources and nonpoint sources.

## Point Source Implementation

Point sources implement TMDLs through NPDES permits.

### Wasteload Allocations Become Permit Limits

When a TMDL is approved, the wasteload allocation (WLA) must be incorporated into NPDES permits:

- **Water Quality-Based Effluent Limits (WQBELs)**: Permit limits derived from WLAs
- More stringent than technology-based limits when needed
- Expressed as concentrations or mass loading

### Permit Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Numeric effluent limits | Direct pollutant discharge limits |
| Receiving water limits | Must not cause exceedance in water body |
| BMP requirements | For pollutants difficult to monitor |
| Monitoring requirements | Track compliance and progress |

### Municipal Stormwater (MS4)

MS4 permits incorporate TMDL requirements through:
- Specific implementation task timelines
- BMP installation requirements
- Trash capture requirements
- Monitoring and reporting

### Caltrans Example

California Department of Transportation demonstrates large-scale TMDL implementation:

- Subject to statewide NPDES permit
- Wasteload allocations under 60+ TMDLs
- TMDL Compliance Plan (updated 2025)
- Implementation includes:
  - Treatment BMPs at facilities
  - Stormwater treatment systems
  - Pollution prevention design principles
  - Fish passage remediation
  - Erosion control

## Nonpoint Source Implementation

Nonpoint sources lack discrete discharge points, requiring different approaches.

### Regulatory and Voluntary Mix

- **Conditional Waivers**: Agricultural operations meeting management practice requirements
- **General Orders**: Categorical requirements for nonpoint source categories
- **Incentive Programs**: Cost-sharing for voluntary BMPs
- **Technical Assistance**: Education and outreach

### Clean Water Act Section 319

Federal funding for nonpoint source implementation:
- Restoration projects
- BMP installation
- Watershed planning
- Technical assistance

California's Nonpoint Source Program uses 319 funds to support TMDL implementation.

### Best Management Practices (BMPs)

Common nonpoint source controls:

| Source Category | BMP Examples |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Agriculture | Cover crops, nutrient management, tailwater recovery |
| Urban Runoff | Bioretention, permeable pavement, green infrastructure |
| Construction | Erosion control, sediment basins, stabilization |
| Forestry | Riparian buffers, road maintenance, harvest practices |

## Major California TMDLs

### Los Angeles River Trash TMDL

**Target**: Zero trash in water column

**Approach**:
- Full capture systems (devices capturing all trash >5mm)
- Institutional controls and source reduction
- Street sweeping optimization
- Public education campaigns

**Implementation**:
- WLAs allocated by jurisdiction and land use
- Nine-year compliance schedule from adoption
- Certified full capture devices receive 100% trash reduction credit
- Partial capture devices credited based on effectiveness studies

**Results**:
- Significant trash reductions achieved
- Full capture system installations across LA County
- Model for other trash TMDLs statewide

### San Francisco Bay Mercury TMDL

**Target**: 0.2 mg/kg fish tissue mercury concentration

**Allocations**:
- Municipal wastewater: 11 kg/year (final)
- Urban runoff: 80 kg/year (with 120 kg/year interim milestone)
- Total allowable load: 700 kg/year

**Implementation**:
- Dental amalgam collection programs
- Industrial source controls
- Green infrastructure for urban runoff
- Sediment management

**Progress**:
- Municipal wastewater loads at 2.9 kg/year (2014) - well below allocation
- Fish tissue mercury remains elevated
- Long-term effort required due to legacy contamination

### Delta Methylmercury TMDL

**Focus**: Methylmercury bioaccumulation in fish tissue

**Adopted**: 2010 (Regional Board), 2011 (EPA approval)

**Approach**:
- Addresses mercury methylation conditions, not just total mercury
- Low dissolved oxygen conditions promote methylation
- Wetland management strategies

**Implementation Phases**:
- **Phase 1**: Characterization and control studies
  - Municipal wastewater dischargers
  - Urban stormwater agencies
  - Tidal wetland managers
- Delta Science Program independent review
- Adaptive management based on study results

### Guadalupe River Watershed Mercury TMDL

**Source**: New Almaden mercury mining district (largest in North America, closed 1975)

**Adopted**: 2008 (Regional Board), 2010 (EPA approval)

**Implementation**:
- Two 10-year phases originally planned
- Phase 1: 2009-2018
- Phase 2: Originally 2019-2028, delayed to 2029

**Status (2022 Review)**:
- Fish mercury levels remain highly elevated
- Exceed TMDL targets in all covered waters
- Mining waste remediation proceeding slower than anticipated
- Implementation timeline extended

**Lesson**: Legacy contamination TMDLs require decades of sustained commitment.

### Lake Elsinore/Canyon Lake Nutrient TMDL

**Pollutants**: Nitrogen and phosphorus

**Issues**:
- Algal blooms
- Low dissolved oxygen
- Impaired recreation

**Approach**:
- Watershed-wide load reductions
- Agricultural practice improvements
- Urban runoff controls
- In-lake management

### North Coast Sediment TMDLs

**Focus**: Excessive sedimentation affecting salmonid habitat

**Implementation Policy**: Comprehensive policy for sediment TMDL implementation

**Approach**:
- Road maintenance requirements
- Timber harvest practice improvements
- Erosion control
- Riparian protection

## Monitoring for Effectiveness

TMDL implementation requires ongoing monitoring:

### Ambient Monitoring
- Water quality conditions in receiving water
- Progress toward numeric targets
- Trend analysis over time

### Compliance Monitoring
- Discharge quality from point sources
- BMP effectiveness
- Load reduction tracking

### Special Studies
- Source identification
- Fate and transport analysis
- Bioaccumulation assessment

## Adaptive Management

TMDLs include triggers for reassessment:

### Review Milestones
- Typically 5-10 year review intervals
- Assess progress toward targets
- Evaluate implementation effectiveness

### Revision Triggers
- New scientific information
- Targets not being met despite implementation
- Changed conditions in watershed
- Unforeseen source contributions

### Adjustment Options
- Revised allocations
- Modified implementation schedules
- Alternative control strategies
- Updated numeric targets (rare)

## Implementation Challenges

### Common Issues

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Legacy contamination | Extended timelines, phased cleanup |
| Diffuse nonpoint sources | Watershed-scale approaches |
| Climate variability | Adaptive management, scenario planning |
| Limited funding | Prioritization, leveraging partnerships |
| Scientific uncertainty | Margin of safety, monitoring feedback |

### Success Factors

- Clear responsibility assignments
- Adequate funding mechanisms
- Stakeholder buy-in
- Effective monitoring programs
- Adaptive management flexibility
