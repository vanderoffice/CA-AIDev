- Explain why you disagree or agree with the proposed action
- Reference specific sections, pages, or language
- Avoid vague or general statements

### Offer Alternatives

- Suggest specific modifications to proposed language
- Offer compromise solutions
- Provide concrete alternatives, not just objections

### Format Considerations

- Type comments if possible (easier to read and quote)
- Organize by topic or section of the document
- Use headings and numbered points for clarity

### Timing

- Submit well in advance of the deadline
- Don't wait until the last minute
- Allow time for technical issues with electronic submission

## Requesting Copies of Comments

To obtain copies of comments submitted by others:

1. Email: commentletters@waterboards.ca.gov
