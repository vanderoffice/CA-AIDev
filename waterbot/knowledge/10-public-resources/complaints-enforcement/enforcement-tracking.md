# Tracking Water Board Enforcement Actions

## Overview

The California Water Boards maintain public databases for tracking enforcement actions, allowing stakeholders to monitor compliance, research facility histories, and understand enforcement patterns. CIWQS (California Integrated Water Quality System) serves as the primary platform for accessing enforcement data.

## CIWQS Enforcement Data

### Accessing Enforcement Information

**CIWQS Public Reports**: https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/publicReports.jsp

The public CIWQS interface provides:
- Violation history by facility
- Enforcement actions issued
- Penalty assessments
- Compliance schedules
- Return to compliance status

### Types of Enforcement Data Available

1. **Violations**: Exceedances of permit limits, missed reports, prohibited discharges
2. **Informal Actions**: Warning letters, notices of violation
3. **Formal Actions**: Administrative Civil Liability (ACL) orders, Cease and Desist Orders (CDO)
4. **Penalties Assessed**: Dollar amounts of fines
5. **Compliance Status**: Current standing of facilities

### Searching for Enforcement Records

**Search Options**:
- By facility name or place ID
- By permit number (NPDES, WDR)
- By geographic area (Region, county, city)
- By violation type
- By date range
- By enforcement action type

## Formal Enforcement Actions

### Administrative Civil Liability (ACL)

ACL orders assess monetary penalties for violations:

**ACL Components**:
- **Citation of violations**: Specific permit conditions violated
- **Penalty calculation**: Based on Water Code methodology
- **Compliance requirements**: Actions needed to return to compliance
- **Payment terms**: Schedule for penalty payment

**Finding ACL Orders**:
- Search CIWQS by facility or region
- Review Regional Board meeting agendas (where ACLs are adopted)
- Access State Water Board Office of Enforcement webpage

### Cease and Desist Orders (CDO)

CDOs require dischargers to stop or correct violations:

**CDO Contents**:
- Description of violation
- Required corrective actions
- Timeline for compliance
- Consequences of non-compliance

### Cleanup and Abatement Orders (CAO)

CAOs address contamination requiring remediation:

**CAO Requirements**:
- Site investigation
- Cleanup plan development
- Implementation timeline
- Monitoring requirements
- Reporting schedule

### Time Schedule Orders (TSO)

TSOs provide compliance schedules for facilities working toward meeting limits:

**TSO Features**:
- Interim limits during upgrade period
- Milestone schedule
- Progress reporting requirements
- Consequences for missed milestones

## Mandatory Minimum Penalties (MMPs)

### Legal Framework

California Water Code sections 13385 and 13385.1 establish MMPs:

**MMP Triggers**:
- Four or more violations of same effluent limit in six-month period
- Serious violations (exceeding limit by 40%+ for toxic pollutants, 20%+ for conventional)
- Failure to file required discharge monitoring reports

**MMP Amounts**:
- $3,000 per violation (minimum)
- Maximum penalties vary by violation type and circumstances

### Tracking MMP Enforcement

CIWQS automatically flags facilities with MMP-qualifying violations:
- View MMP status in facility compliance summaries
- Track MMP orders through Regional Board actions
- Review statewide MMP statistics in annual enforcement reports

## Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs)

### What are SEPs?

SEPs allow violators to direct a portion of penalties to environmental projects:

**Eligible Projects**:
- Pollution prevention
- Habitat restoration
- Environmental education
- Water quality monitoring
- Community environmental health

**SEP Requirements**:
- Must benefit environment or public health
- Cannot be required by law
- Geographic/subject matter connection to violation
- Independent oversight

### Finding SEP Information

- Regional Board meeting agendas (SEP proposals)
- Settlement agreements with SEP components
- Annual enforcement reports listing completed SEPs

## Settlement Agreements

### Public Access to Settlements

Settlement agreements between Water Boards and violators are public documents:

**How to Access**:
- CIWQS enforcement action records
- Regional Board meeting minutes
- Public Records Act requests
- State Water Board Office of Enforcement files

**Settlement Components Typically Include**:
- Agreed penalty amount
- Compliance requirements
- Reporting obligations
- SEP commitments (if applicable)
- Stipulated facts

## Enforcement Reports and Statistics

### Annual Enforcement Reports

The State Water Board publishes annual enforcement summaries:

**Report Contents**:
- Total violations by type
- Penalties assessed statewide
- Regional comparisons
- Trends over time
- Significant enforcement actions

**FY 2024-25 Statistics** (example data):
- Total penalties assessed: ~$29.1 million
- Number of formal enforcement actions: varies by region
- Top violation categories: effluent limits, monitoring/reporting

### Accessing Historical Data

**CIWQS Historical Reports**:
- Violation trend reports
- Penalty history by facility
- Compliance improvement tracking

**Public Records Act Requests**:
- For records not available online
- Investigation files
- Correspondence with regulated facilities

## Using Enforcement Data

### Due Diligence Research

When researching facilities for:
- Property transactions
- Business acquisitions
- Contractor qualification
- Community awareness

**Key Information to Review**:
1. Current compliance status
2. Historical violation patterns
3. Outstanding enforcement orders
4. Penalty payment history
5. Cleanup obligations

### Community Monitoring

Residents and organizations can use enforcement data to:
- Track local facility compliance
- Prepare for public comment at hearings
- Support advocacy efforts
- Identify patterns requiring attention

### Environmental Justice Analysis

Enforcement data supports EJ analysis:
- Compare enforcement across communities
- Identify disparities in compliance
- Track response to EJ community complaints

## Data Limitations

### What's Not in CIWQS

- Pre-2000 enforcement actions (varies by region)
- Some informal enforcement (verbal warnings)
- Ongoing investigation details
- Confidential business information
- Some water rights enforcement

### Data Accuracy

- Information entered by Regional Board staff
- May have lag between action and database entry
- Historical records may be incomplete
- Contact Regional Board for clarification on specific records
