# Filing Complaints with California Water Boards

## Overview

The California Water Boards accept complaints about water quality violations, illegal discharges, and water rights issues. The complaint system provides multiple pathways for reporting environmental concerns, with different processes depending on the type of violation.

## Water Quality Complaints

### CalEPA Complaint System

Water quality complaints are filed through the California Environmental Protection Agency's unified complaint system:

**Online Filing**: CalEPA Complaint Portal
- URL: https://calepacomplaints.secure.force.com/
- Available 24/7
- Accepts photos and documentation uploads
- Generates tracking number for follow-up

**By Phone**:
- CalEPA hotline for environmental complaints
- Regional Water Board offices during business hours
- Emergency spills: Office of Emergency Services (OES)

### Types of Water Quality Complaints

1. **Illegal Discharges**: Unpermitted releases to surface waters or storm drains
2. **Permit Violations**: Facilities exceeding permit limits
3. **Sewage Spills**: Sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs)
4. **Stormwater Violations**: Construction site runoff, industrial stormwater issues
5. **Agricultural Discharges**: Waste from farming operations
6. **Groundwater Contamination**: Pollution affecting drinking water sources

### What to Include in a Complaint

For effective investigation, provide:
- **Location**: Specific address or GPS coordinates
- **Date/Time**: When violation was observed
- **Description**: What you observed (color, odor, materials)
- **Photos/Videos**: Visual documentation if safe to obtain
- **Witness Information**: Contact details (can be anonymous)
- **Suspected Source**: If known, identify potential responsible party

## Water Rights Complaints

### Division of Water Rights Process

Water rights complaints address unauthorized diversions or misuse of water:

**Filing Methods**:
- Online through Division of Water Rights portal
- Mail to Division of Water Rights, P.O. Box 2000, Sacramento, CA 95812
- Email to wrcomplaints@waterboards.ca.gov

**Common Water Rights Complaints**:
1. Unauthorized diversions (no permit/license)
2. Diversions exceeding permitted amounts
3. Violations of permit conditions
4. Failure to file required reports
5. Interference with senior water rights

### Required Information for Water Rights Complaints

- Complainant contact information
- Location of alleged violation (Township, Range, Section if known)
- Description of unauthorized activity
- Evidence of harm or potential harm
- Any known information about the diverter

## Anonymous Complaint Options

Both water quality and water rights complaints can be filed anonymously:

**Anonymous Considerations**:
- No contact information required
- Limited ability for investigators to follow up for clarification
- Complaint still investigated if sufficient information provided
- Cannot receive status updates without contact information

**When Anonymity May Be Appropriate**:
- Concerns about retaliation from employer
- Neighbor disputes with safety concerns
- Whistleblower situations

## Complaint Investigation Process

### Initial Review

Upon receipt, complaints are:
1. Logged into tracking system
2. Assigned to appropriate Regional Board or Division
3. Prioritized based on severity and threat to public health/environment

### Prioritization Criteria

**High Priority**:
- Immediate threat to public health
- Direct discharge to drinking water source
- Fish kills or wildlife impacts
- Large volume spills

**Standard Priority**:
- Ongoing minor violations
- Permit compliance issues
- Historical contamination

### Investigation Timeline

- **Emergency complaints**: Immediate response (same day)
- **High priority**: Investigation within days to weeks
- **Standard complaints**: May take weeks to months depending on Regional Board workload

### Possible Outcomes

1. **No Violation Found**: Complaint closed with documentation
2. **Violation Confirmed**: Enforcement action initiated
3. **Referral**: Transferred to another agency if appropriate
4. **Technical Assistance**: Violator given opportunity to correct
5. **Formal Enforcement**: ACL, CDO, or other action issued

## Following Up on Complaints
