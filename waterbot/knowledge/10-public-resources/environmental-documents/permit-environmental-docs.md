# Environmental Documentation for Water Board Permits

## Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certifications

### Purpose

Section 401 provides states an important tool to protect water quality when federal agencies issue permits for activities that may result in discharges to waters of the United States.

### Process

1. **Pre-filing meeting**: Required at least 30 days before application submission
2. **Application submission**: Individual applications for certification or WDRs
3. **Completeness review**: Within 30 days of receipt
4. **Environmental review**: Analysis of potential water quality impacts
5. **Certification decision**: Issue, deny, or waive

### Who Handles 401 Certifications

| Project Type | Certifying Authority |
|--------------|---------------------|
| FERC licenses, water rights diversions | State Water Board |
| Other 401 certifications | Regional Water Boards |

## Antidegradation Analysis

### What It Is

Required analysis to prevent unnecessary degradation of water quality in high-quality waters.

### When Required

- NPDES permitting
- Load allocation and waste load allocation development
- Total maximum daily load (TMDL) establishment
- Other major regulatory actions affecting water quality

### Analysis Types

**Simple Analysis**: Used when discharge will not be adverse to antidegradation requirements (based on best professional judgment).

**Complete Analysis**: Required when proposed activity results in significant increase in pollutant loadings.

### Where to Find It

- **Major NPDES permits**: Summarized in fact sheet
- **Minor NPDES permits**: Summarized in statement of basis
- **Projects requiring CEQA**: Integrated into environmental review documents

### Considerations

1. Would discharge reduce water quality?
2. Is reduction consistent with maximum public benefit?
3. Would reduction unreasonably affect beneficial uses?
4. Would water quality fall below established objectives?

## NPDES Permit Fact Sheets

### Purpose

Documents the permit writer's analysis and reasoning for permit conditions.

### Required Contents

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Facility information | Permitted activity, type, quantity of pollutants |
| Receiving water | Characteristics, impairment status |
| Effluent limitations | Technology-based and water quality-based limits |
| Basis for limits | Rationale for each limitation |
| Monitoring requirements | Sampling frequencies, parameters |
| Compliance schedule | If applicable |

### Types of Effluent Limitations

**Technology-Based:**
- Best Conventional Technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants
- Best Available Technology (BAT) for toxic/non-conventional pollutants

**Water Quality-Based:**
- Ensure discharge won't cause/contribute to WQ standard violations
- May include whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing
- Indicator parameters as needed

### Access

Fact sheets are public documents available:
- With permit when issued
- Through public records request
- Often posted on Regional Board websites

## Waste Discharge Requirements Documentation

### Environmental Review

For WDRs that trigger CEQA:

- Environmental review documentation submitted with WDR
- Both environmental analysis and permit conditions considered together
- Regional Board reviews in single proceeding

### Public Notice Process

1. Regional Board prepares tentative order
2. 30-day public comment period
3. Notice specifies where to submit written comments
4. Board meeting for adoption/modification

### Supporting Documentation

WDR files typically include:

- Report of Waste Discharge (application)
- Technical reports and studies
- Monitoring and reporting program
- Environmental review documentation
- Response to comments

## How to Request Permit Files

### Online Access

Many permits and supporting documents available online:

- State Water Board website by program
- Regional Board websites
- CIWQS permit search

### Public Records Request

For documents not online:

**State Water Board:**
- Public Records Center
- 1001 I Street, Sacramento, CA 95814
- Various program coordinators listed online

**Regional Water Boards:**
- Contact specific Regional Board
- Office hours: Weekdays 8am-5pm
- May allow private copy services

### Program-Specific Contacts

| Program | Contact |
|---------|---------|
