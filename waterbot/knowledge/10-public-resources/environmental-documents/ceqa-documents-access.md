# Accessing CEQA Documents for Water Board Projects

## Overview

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires environmental review for discretionary governmental actions, including Water Board permits, water quality standards, and funding decisions. Understanding how to access CEQA documents helps stakeholders participate in environmental review processes.

## Types of CEQA Documents

### Categorical Exemption

Projects determined not to have significant environmental effects may qualify for exemption. No CEQA document is required.

**Examples for water projects:**
- Minor repairs to existing dams under DWR supervision
- Water main extensions for new construction

### Negative Declaration

A brief report stating the project will not have a significant environmental effect.

**Characteristics:**
- No extensive detailed analysis required
- Concise explanation of why impacts are insignificant
- Typically 20-30 day public review period

### Mitigated Negative Declaration

Used when potentially significant effects can be reduced to less-than-significant levels through mitigation.

**Includes:**
- Specific mitigation measures
- Mitigation monitoring and reporting program
- Project proponent's agreement to implement measures

### Environmental Impact Report (EIR)

Comprehensive document for projects with potentially significant unavoidable effects.

**Contains:**
- Project description
- Environmental setting baseline
- Analysis of all environmental impacts
- Mitigation measures
- Alternatives analysis
- Response to public comments

**Review period:** Typically 45 days minimum

## Water Board CEQA Document Repositories

### Division of Water Rights

[Water Rights CEQA Page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/ceqa/)

**Contains:**
- Notice of Proposed Mitigated Negative Declarations
- Proposed Initial Studies
- Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plans
- Draft permits and licenses
- Final orders

**Updated as:** Documents released for comment and decisions made

### Division of Financial Assistance

[Lead Agency Documents Page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/grants_loans/ceqa/lead-agency-documents.html)

- CEQA documents for funded water projects
- Division of Drinking Water permits
- Funding-related environmental reviews

### Regional Water Boards

Each Regional Board maintains its own CEQA repository:

- Check the specific Regional Board website
- Look under "Public Notices" or "Environmental Review"
- Documents organized by project or program

## Lead Agency vs. Responsible Agency

### Lead Agency

The agency with principal responsibility for carrying out or approving the project.

**For Water Board-funded projects:**
- Usually the public agency receiving funding
- Only public agencies can be lead agencies
- Responsible for preparing CEQA documents

### Responsible Agency

An agency other than the lead agency with approval authority for some project aspect.

**Water Board as responsible agency:**
- Reviews lead agency's CEQA documents
- Makes its own CEQA findings
- Issues water quality certifications, permits, or other approvals

### Example

| Project Aspect | Agency Role |
|----------------|-------------|
| City water project | City = Lead Agency |
| State funding | State Water Board = Responsible Agency |
| Water quality certification | Regional Board = Responsible Agency |

## Certified Regulatory Programs

The Secretary for Natural Resources has certified certain Water Board programs as exempt from traditional CEQA (Chapters 3 and 4).

### Certified Programs Include

- Basin and Water Quality Control Planning program
- Instream beneficial use protection program

### What This Means

- Exempt from EIR, negative declaration, initial study requirements
- Still must conduct environmental review under alternative procedures
- Must follow Title 23, Chapter 27 regulations

### What Is NOT Exempt

- Water rights actions
- Water quality certifications
- New sources under Clean Water Act (require full CEQA)

## Water Code Section 13389 Exemption

Waste discharge requirements are exempt from CEQA **only** if:

- They serve as an NPDES permit under Water Code Section 13377
- They are NOT for "new sources" as defined in the Clean Water Act

**Common misunderstanding:** This exemption does NOT apply to all waste discharge requirements.
