## SWAMP Data Systems

The Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP) generates water quality data for California's streams, lakes, rivers, and coastal waters.

### SWAMP Data Dashboard

- Interactive exploration of SWAMP monitoring data
- Water quality trend analysis over time
- Public beta phase (data is provisional)
- Contact: OIMA-Helpdesk@waterboards.ca.gov

### SWAMP Data Warehouse

- Staff and partner laboratory access
- Quick dataset downloads within SWAMP collection
- Searchable by data type (BMI Results, etc.)

### Monitoring Programs

1. **Bioaccumulation Monitoring**: Contaminant accumulation in fish
2. **Bioassessment Program**: Benthic macroinvertebrates and habitat
3. **FHAB Program**: Freshwater and estuarine harmful algal blooms
4. **Stream Pollution Trends**: Long-term pollution assessment
5. **Regional Monitoring Programs**: Region-specific concerns
6. **Clean Water Team**: Citizen science monitoring
7. **SeMMAP**: Environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring

## California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN)

CEDEN serves as a central location to find and share water body information.

### Data Types

- Water quality
- Aquatic habitat
- Wildlife health
- Benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomy
- Toxicity data

### Data Submission

Six-step process for contributing data:
1. Register with Regional Data Center
2. Select appropriate template (Chemistry, Taxonomy, Tissue, Toxicity, Bioassessment)
3. Follow guidance documents for data formatting
4. Submit to Regional Data Center
5. Data undergoes QA/QC
6. Data published to CEDEN

### CEDEN Query Tool

- Advanced query interface
- Filter by project type, monitoring program, location, time
- Export to various formats

## CASGEM Groundwater Elevation Monitoring

The California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring (CASGEM) Program tracks groundwater elevation trends since 2009.

### Purpose

- Establish permanent local monitoring programs
- Track seasonal and long-term groundwater trends
- Support SGMA implementation

### Current Status

CASGEM is being integrated with the SGMA Portal to:
- Streamline data management
- Consolidate reporting processes
- Provide unified user experience
