# California Water Data Portals Overview

## California Open Data Portal

The California Open Data Portal (data.ca.gov) serves as the primary aggregation point for datasets maintained by state agencies. Water data represents one of the most substantial collections within this system.

### Water Boards Data Commitment

On July 10, 2018, the State Water Board adopted the Open Data Resolution (Resolution No. 2018-0032) establishing five core principles for open data:

1. Water data should be freely available
2. Data should be machine-readable
3. Data should follow national technical standards
4. Data should be formatted to facilitate visibility and re-use
5. Data should support transparency in water resource management

### Available Datasets

As of 2025, the Water Boards maintain **494 datasets** on the California Open Data Portal covering:

- **Drinking water safety**: SAFER Dashboard, failing and at-risk water systems
- **Groundwater conditions**: Periodic groundwater level measurements, SGMA data
- **Surface water quality**: SWAMP Data Dashboard, toxicity results, harmful algal blooms
- **Water rights administration**: Diversion data, permit information
- **Compliance and enforcement**: Regulated facility information, violations

### Key Datasets

| Dataset | Description | Update Frequency |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| SAFER Dashboard | Failing/at-risk water systems | Daily |
| Freshwater Harmful Algal Blooms | FHAB temporal and spatial data | Ongoing |
| Periodic Groundwater Levels | Seasonal/long-term elevation data | Periodic |
| GSP Monitoring Data | SGMA reporting from GSAs | Annual |
| SWAMP Data Dashboard | Surface water quality | Ongoing |

## Assembly Bill 1755: Open and Transparent Water Data Act

AB 1755 required the Department of Water Resources, in consultation with the California Water Quality Monitoring Council, State Water Board, and Department of Fish and Wildlife, to create and maintain a statewide integrated water data platform.

### Key Requirements

- Establish a permanent integrated water data platform
- Ensure interoperability between state water agencies
- Provide public access to comprehensive water data
- Support data-driven decision making

## Data Transparency Initiatives

### Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA)

Established in 2008, OIMA serves as:

- An advocate for data management
- A bridge between data collectors and users
- A source of transparency for Water Board information infrastructure

### Core Values

1. **Trust**: Reliable data sources and processes
2. **Adaptation**: Innovation in products and services
3. **Partnership**: Collaboration and relationship building
4. **Quality**: Systematic processes for data integrity

### College of Water Informatics (CoWI)

Launched in 2021, CoWI delivers data literacy training throughout the Water Boards. Water Informatics is defined as an interdisciplinary science focused on the collection, storage, analysis, and communication of water data.
