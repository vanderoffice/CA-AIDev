# Electronic Water Rights Information Management System (eWRIMS) and CalWATRS

## Overview

eWRIMS was a computer database developed by the State Water Resources Control Board to track water rights information in California. It was deployed on October 1, 2007.

**Important**: As of June 9, 2025, eWRIMS has been decommissioned and replaced by CalWATRS.

## eWRIMS Legacy Information

### What eWRIMS Contained

- **Statements of Water Diversion and Use**: Filed by water diverters
- **Registrations**: Small domestic use, livestock stockpond
- **Certificates**: Pre-statutory appropriations
- **Permits**: Post-1914 appropriative rights in process
- **Licenses**: Perfected post-1914 appropriative rights

### Search Capabilities (Historical)

Users could search water rights by:

- Water right owner's name
- Watershed
- Stream system
- County
- Water right ID number

### GIS Mapping

The Water Rights Web Mapping Application provided:

- Spatial location of water rights throughout California
- Points of diversion on maps/aerial photos

## CalWATRS: The New System

CalWATRS (California Water Accounting, Tracking, and Reporting System) replaced eWRIMS in July 2025.

### Key Features

- Streamlined water rights record viewing
- Annual report filing
- Water rights services requests
- Organizational account management

### Account Access

**Important**: eWRIMS usernames and passwords do NOT work in CalWATRS.

To access CalWATRS:

1. Obtain your PIN (mailed October-November 2025)
2. Create a new CalWATRS account
3. Link your water rights using the PIN

If you haven't received a PIN: CalWATRS-help@waterboards.ca.gov

### Organizational Accounts

For businesses and government agencies:

- Create an "organization" within CalWATRS
- Multiple staff can access and manage organization's water rights
- Centralized control with delegated administrative responsibilities

## Statements of Water Diversion and Use

### Legal Requirement

Water Code Section 5101 requires anyone who:

- Uses diverted surface water after December 31, 1965, OR
- Pumps groundwater from a known subterranean stream

To file a Statement before February 1 of the following year.

### Important Distinction

**A Statement is NOT a confirmed water right.** It is simply a statement made by the diverter. Division of Water Rights staff do not analyze or verify the legal water right status.

### Statement Contents

- Point of diversion location
- Amount of water used during the water year
- Source information
- Place of use

## Water Right Types Tracked

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Appropriative (Post-1914)** | Rights obtained through permit/license process |
| **Appropriative (Pre-1914)** | Rights established before 1914 Water Commission Act |
| **Riparian** | Rights based on land ownership adjacent to water |
| **Groundwater** | Subterranean stream diversions |
| **Registrations** | Small domestic use, livestock stockponds |
