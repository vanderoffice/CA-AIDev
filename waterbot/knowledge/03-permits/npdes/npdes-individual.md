# Individual NPDES Permits

## When Is an Individual Permit Required?

An **individual NPDES permit** is tailored specifically to a particular facility's discharge characteristics, unlike general permits that cover multiple similar facilities under uniform conditions. The Regional Water Quality Control Board determines whether an individual permit is required based on:

**Individual permit required when:**
- Unique discharge characteristics that don't fit general permit categories
- Discharge to sensitive or impaired waters
- Complex treatment systems requiring site-specific conditions
- General permit conditions aren't appropriate for the discharge type
- Discharge volume or pollutant loading requires customized limits
- Facility type not covered by an existing general permit

**General permit coverage allowed when:**
- Discharge falls within a defined category (construction, industrial stormwater, etc.)
- Facility meets all eligibility requirements of the general permit
- Standard conditions adequately protect water quality

**Key distinction:** General permits provide coverage via Notice of Intent (NOI) with immediate or near-immediate authorization. Individual permits require full application review, public notice, board hearing, and EPA review—typically 6+ months.

## Application Requirements

### Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD)

California Water Code Section 13260 requires any person discharging or proposing to discharge waste that could affect water quality to file a **Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD)** with the appropriate Regional Water Board.

**Required Application Components:**

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Form 200** | State application/general information form for WDRs and NPDES permits |
| **Technical Report** | Detailed discharge characterization signed by a registered civil engineer |
| **Federal EPA Forms** | Form 1 (all applicants) plus facility-specific forms (2A-2F) |
| **Application Fee** | Varies by region and facility type |

**Federal Forms by Facility Type:**
- **Form 2A** - POTWs and treatment works treating domestic sewage
- **Form 2C** - Existing manufacturing, commercial, mining, silvicultural
- **Form 2D** - New manufacturing, commercial, mining, silvicultural
- **Form 2E** - Non-manufacturing facilities (commercial, service)
- **Form 2F** - Stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity

**Technical Report Requirements** (varies by Regional Board):
- Description of wastes to be discharged
- Characteristics of discharge materials
- Treatment method or containment approach
- Receiving water characteristics
- Manner of conveyance to receiving water
- Flow rates, volumes, and discharge frequency
- Pollutant concentrations (sampling data)
- Site map and facility layout

**Critical:** Contact your Regional Board staff before submitting to obtain specific technical report requirements for your discharge type and facility.

## Effluent Limitations Development

NPDES permits establish two types of effluent limitations that work together to protect water quality:

### Technology-Based Effluent Limitations (TBELs)

TBELs represent the **minimum** level of treatment required, regardless of receiving water conditions.

**For POTWs (Secondary Treatment Standards per 40 CFR Part 133):**

| Parameter | 30-Day Average | 7-Day Average | Minimum Removal |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| BOD₅ | ≤30 mg/L | ≤45 mg/L | ≥85% |
| TSS | ≤30 mg/L | ≤45 mg/L | ≥85% |
| pH | 6.0–9.0 SU | — | — |

**Equivalent to Secondary Treatment** (for trickling filters or stabilization ponds with qualifying characteristics):
- BOD₅: ≤40 mg/L (30-day average)
- TSS: ≤65 mg/L (30-day average)
- Removal: ≥65% for both parameters

**For Industrial Facilities:**
- Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT) for toxics and non-conventional pollutants
- Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants
- Industry-specific effluent guidelines in 40 CFR Parts 405–471

### Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations (WQBELs)

WQBELs are **more stringent** than TBELs where necessary to meet water quality standards.

**Development Process:**
1. Identify applicable water quality standards (Basin Plan objectives, California Toxics Rule)
2. Conduct reasonable potential analysis to determine if discharge may cause exceedance
3. If reasonable potential exists, calculate WQBELs using:
   - Receiving water dilution and mixing zone analysis
   - Effluent variability factors
   - Water quality criteria (acute and chronic)
4. Apply the more stringent of TBEL or WQBEL

**Key California Standards:**
- **California Toxics Rule (CTR)** - EPA-promulgated numeric criteria for priority toxics
- **Basin Plans** - Regional water quality objectives for beneficial uses
- **State Implementation Policy (SIP)** - Standardized approach for permitting toxic pollutant discharges
- **Resolution 68-16 (Anti-degradation)** - High-quality waters must be maintained

## Public Notice and Hearing Process

The individual permit process includes mandatory public participation:

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Draft Permit Preparation**
- Regional Board staff reviews complete application
- Staff prepares draft permit with proposed conditions
- Staff prepares fact sheet explaining permit basis

**2. Public Notice (30-day comment period)**
- Discharger must publish notice one day in the largest circulation newspaper in the municipality/county
- Notice must include:
  - Name and address of permitting authority and applicant
  - Brief description of activity and receiving water
  - Location and type/quantity of pollutants
  - Where to review application and draft permit
  - How to submit comments or request a hearing
- Proof of publication submitted to Board within 15 days

**3. Public Hearing**
- Regional Board holds public hearing to consider comments
- Notice of hearing given at least 30 days before
- All comments must be considered
- Board may modify permit based on comments received

**4. Board Adoption**
- Majority vote of Regional Board members required
- Board may adopt as proposed, modify, or decline to adopt
- Creates final adopted permit document

**5. EPA Review (30 days)**
- EPA has 30 days to review and potentially object
- If EPA objects, Board must revise permit or demonstrate objection is without merit
- Permit takes effect after EPA review period (typically 30 days after EPA receipt)

## Typical Permit Conditions

Every NPDES permit contains standard conditions plus facility-specific requirements:

### Standard Conditions
- Duty to comply with all permit conditions
- Duty to reapply for renewal 180 days before expiration
- Proper operation and maintenance of treatment facilities
- Monitoring and records retention (typically 3–5 years)
- Reporting requirements (DMRs, annual reports, non-compliance)
- Twenty-four hour reporting for certain violations
- Bypass and upset provisions
- Planned changes notification

### Self-Monitoring Requirements

Permits specify monitoring for compliance assessment:

| Element | Typical Requirements |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Locations** | Effluent (after treatment), internal wastestreams, receiving water |
| **Frequency** | Weekly, monthly, quarterly depending on parameter and discharge |
| **Parameters** | Flow, pH, BOD, TSS, ammonia, toxics, metals (facility-specific) |
| **Methods** | 40 CFR Part 136 approved analytical methods |
| **QA/QC** | Calibration, blanks, duplicates per approved methods |

**Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs):**
- Submitted electronically via CIWQS/eSMR 2.5
- Monthly or quarterly depending on permit
- Must report all required parameters with appropriate statistics
- Late or incomplete DMRs constitute violations

**Tiered Monitoring:**
- Facilities with consistent compliance may qualify for reduced monitoring
- Poor compliance history may trigger increased monitoring
- Reductions determined parameter-by-parameter at permit renewal

## Permit Renewal Process

### Timeline Requirements

- **Maximum term:** 5 years (per Clean Water Act)
- **Renewal application due:** At least **180 days before expiration**
- **Administrative continuation:** If timely application submitted but new permit not issued, existing permit remains in effect

### Renewal Application Contents
- Updated Report of Waste Discharge (Form 200)
- Current facility and discharge information
- Any changes from previous application
- Updated technical report if discharge characteristics changed
- Current monitoring data and compliance status

### Administrative Continuation
If you submit a complete renewal application at least 180 days before expiration but the Board hasn't issued a new permit by the expiration date:
- Existing permit is "administratively continued"
- All permit conditions remain in full force
- Continues until new permit is issued
- Permittee remains responsible for full compliance

**Anti-Backsliding:** New permits generally cannot be less stringent than the prior permit unless specific exceptions apply.

## Timeline: Application to Permit Issuance

**Typical timeline: 6–12 months** (complex facilities may take longer)

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Application submission** | Day 0 | Submit complete ROWD, forms, fee |
| **Completeness review** | 2–4 weeks | Staff reviews, may request additional info |
| **Draft permit preparation** | 4–8 weeks | Staff develops permit conditions |
| **Public notice period** | 30 days | Public comment, newspaper publication |
| **Comment response** | 2–4 weeks | Staff prepares responses to comments |
| **Board hearing** | 1 day | Board considers permit for adoption |
| **EPA review** | 30 days | EPA reviews adopted permit |
| **Effective date** | After EPA review | Permit takes effect |

**Factors that extend timeline:**
- Incomplete applications requiring additional information
- Complex discharge characteristics
- Sensitive or impaired receiving waters
- Contested permits with significant public opposition
- EPA objections requiring permit revision
- TMDL requirements needing coordination

**New dischargers:** Must submit applications at least 180 days before expected discharge commencement.

### Industrial Facilities

Industrial dischargers with process wastewater require individual permits when:
- Not eligible for Industrial General Permit (IGP) coverage
- Discharge process wastewater (not just stormwater)
- Have unique discharge characteristics

**Key Requirements:**
- Effluent guidelines (40 CFR Parts 405–471) for specific industries
- BAT/BCT technology-based limits

Coastal and estuarine power plants with once-through cooling have specific requirements:

**Once-Through Cooling (OTC) Policy:**
- Adopted by State Water Board April 7, 2010
- Applied to 19 existing power plants withdrawing ~16 billion gallons/day
- Requires Best Technology Available (BTA) for cooling water intake structures

**Compliance Options:**
- **Track 1:** Reduce intake flow and velocity (closed-cycle cooling)
- **Track 2:** Reduce aquatic life impacts by other means

**Current Status (2025):**
- 10 plants ceased OTC operations
- 8 plants retired or converted to non-water-cooled systems
- Only Moss Landing continues OTC under Track 2 measures

**Clean Water Act Section 316(b):**
- Requires BTA for cooling water intake structures
- Minimizes impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms

## Federal Requirements (40 CFR Part 122)

Individual NPDES permits must comply with federal regulations:

**40 CFR 122.21** - Application requirements
- Specifies required forms and information
- Establishes 180-day advance application requirement

**40 CFR 122.44** - Permit conditions
- Technology-based effluent limitations
- Water quality-based effluent limitations where necessary
- Monitoring and reporting requirements
- Best management practices

**40 CFR 122.46** - Permit duration
- Maximum 5-year term
- Renewal required for continued discharge

**40 CFR Part 124** - Procedures
- Public notice and comment requirements
- Hearing procedures
- EPA review and objection process

**California Implementation:**
- State Water Board and Regional Boards have delegated authority since 1973
- EPA-California MOA governs the relationship
- EPA retains 30-day review period for all state-issued permits
- EPA can object if federal requirements not met

## Recent Enforcement and Notable Cases

### City and County of San Francisco (2025)
- **Violation:** Failure to minimize CSO discharges, failure to disinfect
- **Impact:** 1.8 billion gallons/year untreated sewage to SF Bay
- **Status:** DOJ/EPA and CA Attorney General civil complaint filed January 2025
- **Lesson:** Permit compliance requires operational implementation, not just permit coverage

### Supreme Court: City and County of San Francisco v. EPA (March 2025)
- **Issue:** Can EPA impose "end-result" permit conditions based on receiving water quality?
- **Holding:** No—Section 1311(b)(1)(C) does not authorize end-result provisions
- **Impact:** Permits must specify permittee actions and discharge parameters, not receiving water achievement

### Statewide Enforcement Statistics (2023)
- 260 wastewater enforcement actions under Clean Water Act
- $6+ million in penalties assessed
- Common violations: effluent limit exceedances, monitoring failures, reporting deficiencies
