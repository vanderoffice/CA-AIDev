# Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permits

## What Is an MS4?

A **Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)** is any conveyance or system of conveyances designed to collect and transport stormwater that is:

- Owned or operated by a state, city, town, county, district, or other public body
- Designed or used for collecting and conveying stormwater
- **Not** a combined sewer system (that mixes stormwater with sanitary sewage)
- **Not** part of a publicly owned treatment works (POTW)

**MS4 includes:**
- Storm drains and catch basins
- Roads with drainage systems
- Municipal streets, curbs, and gutters
- Ditches and man-made channels
- Pipes and culverts

**Non-traditional MS4s:**
- State transportation departments (Caltrans)
- Universities and colleges
- Military bases
- Hospitals and prisons
- Any public entity with a drainage system discharging to waters of the US

**Why MS4 permits matter:** Unlike industrial or wastewater point sources, stormwater pollution comes from diffuse sources across entire communities—streets, lawns, parking lots, construction sites. MS4 permits require municipalities to manage these distributed pollution sources.

## The Two-Phase MS4 Program

Congress established the MS4 program through 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act. EPA implemented it in two phases:

### Phase I (1990) - Large and Medium Systems

**Applicability:** MS4s serving populations of **100,000 or greater**

**Nationwide scope:**
- ~855 MS4s covered
- ~250 individual permits

**California approach:** Regional Water Boards issue regional permits covering entire metropolitan areas rather than individual permits for each city.

**Key requirements:**
- Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP)
- Reduce pollutant discharge to Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP)
- Public participation and reporting

### Phase II (1999) - Small Systems

**Applicability:** Small MS4s in **urbanized areas with population ≥50,000** (per Census Bureau)

**Note:** EPA clarified in June 2023 that "urban areas with population of at least 50,000" replaced the discontinued "urbanized area" designation.

**California approach:** Single statewide general permit covers all Phase II MS4s.

**Key requirements:**
- Six Minimum Control Measures (MCMs)
- Stormwater Management Plan
- Annual reporting

| Feature | Phase I | Phase II |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Population threshold | ≥100,000 | In urban areas ≥50,000 |
| Permit type (CA) | Regional permits | Statewide general permit |
| Issuing authority | Regional Boards | State Water Board |
| Requirements | Comprehensive SWMP | Six Minimum Control Measures |

## Phase I MS4 Permits in California

California's Regional Water Boards issue **regional MS4 permits** covering groups of co-permittees within watersheds. This facilitates watershed-based planning and coordinated pollution control.

### Current Regional Phase I MS4 Permits

| Region | Permit | Coverage |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Region 1** (North Coast) | Order R1-2015-0030 | Santa Rosa, Sonoma County cities, Ukiah |
| **Region 2** (SF Bay) | Order R2-2022-0018 | Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano counties |
| **Region 3** (Central Coast) | Order R3-2019-0073 | City of Salinas |
| **Region 4** (Los Angeles) | Order R4-2021-0105 | 99 permittees in LA/Ventura coastal watersheds |
| **Region 5** (Central Valley) | Order R5-2016-0040 | Sacramento, Stockton, Fresno, Bakersfield areas |
| **Region 6** (Lahontan) | Order R6T-2022-0046 | Lake Tahoe municipalities |
| **Region 7** (Colorado River) | Order R7-2013-0011 | Whitewater River Watershed |
| **Region 8** (Santa Ana) | Order R8-2024-0001 | Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino counties |
| **Region 9** (San Diego) | Order R9-2013-0001 (amended) | 39 permittees in SD, Orange, Riverside counties |

### Phase I Permit Requirements

**Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) must address:**
- Program management and coordination
- Identification of outfalls and receiving waters
- Source identification and pollutant loading analysis
- Industrial and commercial facility controls
- Illicit discharge detection and elimination
- Construction site oversight
- New development and redevelopment controls
- Public education and participation

**Standard: Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP)**

The MEP standard requires a comprehensive program combining:
- Public education and outreach
- Infrastructure improvements
- Regulatory enforcement
- Best Management Practices (BMPs)

MEP differs from technology-based standards—it requires programs tailored to local conditions demonstrating measurable pollutant reduction.

- WQ 2018-0007-EXEC
- WQ 2019-0009-EXEC

**Coverage:**
- Small MS4s in urbanized areas throughout California
- Non-traditional MS4s (military bases, universities, hospitals, prisons)
- Municipalities newly designated based on 2020 Census data

### How to Obtain Coverage

1. Determine if your MS4 requires coverage (urbanized area ≥50,000 population)
2. Submit **Notice of Intent (NOI)** to Regional Water Board
3. Develop **Stormwater Management Plan** addressing Six MCMs
4. Implement program and submit annual reports

**Source:** [State Water Board Phase II Permit](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/phase_ii_municipal.html)


## The Six Minimum Control Measures (MCMs)

Phase II MS4 permits require implementation of six specific program elements. When implemented together, these measures significantly reduce stormwater pollutant discharges.

### MCM 1: Public Education and Outreach

**Purpose:** Inform citizens about stormwater pollution impacts and behavior changes needed.

**Requirements:**

## TMDL Implementation Requirements

MS4 permits must incorporate **Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)** requirements for impaired waterbodies.

### What Is a TMDL?

A TMDL is the maximum amount of a pollutant a waterbody can receive while still meeting water quality standards:

**TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS**

Where:
- **WLA** = Wasteload Allocations (point sources including MS4s)
- **LA** = Load Allocations (nonpoint sources, background)
- **MOS** = Margin of Safety

### How TMDLs Affect MS4 Permits

1. Regional Boards develop TMDLs for impaired waters
2. TMDLs assign **wasteload allocations** to MS4 discharges
3. MS4 permits incorporate these allocations as **water quality-based effluent limits (WQBELs)**
4. Permittees must demonstrate compliance or implement approved compliance schedules

### Common TMDL Pollutants for MS4s

| Pollutant | Sources | Controls |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Bacteria/Pathogens** | Pet waste, homeless encampments, sanitary sewer leaks | IDDE, pet waste programs, SSO reduction |
| **Trash** | Litter, illegal dumping | Full capture devices, street sweeping, education |
| **Sediment** | Construction, erosion | Construction controls, stabilization |
| **Nutrients** | Fertilizers, landscaping | Fertilizer management, LID |
| **Metals** | Vehicles, industrial | Source control, treatment BMPs |
| **Pesticides** | Urban applications | IPM programs, education |
| **PCBs/Mercury** | Historical contamination | Source identification, sediment management |

### TMDL Compliance Pathways (San Diego Example)

1. **Wasteload Allocation Pathway** - Achieve specific effluent concentrations/loads
2. **Receiving Water Pathway** - Demonstrate receiving water meets standards
3. **Water Quality Improvement Plan** - Alternative compliance through approved plan

### Time Schedule Orders

Permittees unable to immediately achieve TMDL compliance may receive **Time Schedule Orders (TSOs)** establishing:
- Phased compliance schedules (typically 3–5 years)
- Interim milestones
- Required pollution prevention measures
- Investigation and monitoring activities

## Co-Permittee Relationships

Regional permits create complex relationships among multiple governmental entities.

### Structure

**Principal Permittee** (typically county or flood control district):
- Coordinates regional implementation
- Primary contact with regulatory agencies
- Ensures permit reporting and monitoring
- Oversight of co-permittee activities

**Co-Permittees** (cities and special districts):
- Implement permit requirements within jurisdiction
- Participate in coordinated regional efforts
- Responsible for individual compliance

### Shared vs. Individual Responsibilities

| Requirement Type | Responsibility |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Regional monitoring | Principal permittee coordinates |
| Watershed planning | Joint effort |
| TMDL implementation | Watershed-specific co-permittees |
| Local ordinances | Individual permittee |
| Municipal operations | Individual permittee |
| Annual reporting | Both (regional + individual sections) |

### Joint Compliance Mechanisms

- **Memoranda of Understanding** between co-permittees
- **Regional programs** (e.g., public education campaigns)
- **Watershed groups** for coordinated TMDL implementation
- **Shared monitoring programs**
- **Regional data management systems**

## Major Compliance Deadlines

### Trash Control (Statewide)

The **Trash Amendments** (adopted April 7, 2015) established a narrative water quality objective prohibiting trash discharge to surface waters.

**Compliance deadline: December 2, 2030** - 100% trash control required

**Compliance options:**
1. **Full Capture Systems** - Certified devices that capture all particles ≥5mm
2. **Partial Capture + Track 1** - Combination approach demonstrating equivalent control

**State Water Board maintains registry of certified full capture systems:**
- Catch basin inserts
- High-flow capacity systems
- Multi-benefit treatment systems

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know if my city needs an MS4 permit?**
A: If your city is in an urbanized area with population ≥50,000 (per Census), you likely need Phase II coverage. Cities ≥100,000 are covered under regional Phase I permits. Contact your Regional Board or check the State Water Board's permit lists.

**Q: What's the difference between MEP and numeric effluent limits?**
A: MEP (Maximum Extent Practicable) is a programmatic standard requiring comprehensive implementation of BMPs. Numeric limits set specific concentration or load targets. MS4 permits increasingly include numeric limits through TMDL wasteload allocations.

**Q: Can a small city get a waiver from Phase II requirements?**
A: Potentially. MS4s serving <1,000 population within urbanized areas may apply for waivers if another MS4 already manages stormwater for that area. Contact the State Water Board.

**Q: What if we can't meet TMDL deadlines?**
A: Request a Time Schedule Order (TSO) from your Regional Board. TSOs establish phased compliance with interim milestones while you implement additional controls.

**Q: Who is responsible when multiple cities share a watershed?**
A: Co-permittees share watershed-level responsibilities while maintaining individual responsibility for their jurisdictions. Regional permits typically assign specific roles through permit language and watershed group coordination.
