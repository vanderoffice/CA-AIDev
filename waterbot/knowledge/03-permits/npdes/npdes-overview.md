# NPDES Permit Program Overview

## What is NPDES?

The **National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)** is the federal permit program that regulates point source discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States. Established under **Section 402 of the Clean Water Act** (33 U.S.C. § 1342), NPDES permits control what pollutants a facility can discharge and under what conditions.

Key principle: Discharging pollutants into navigable waters is not a right—it's a privilege granted only to those who obtain a permit and comply with its conditions.

## Federal-State Partnership

### EPA Delegation to California

The EPA has delegated NPDES permitting authority to California, meaning the **State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board)** and **nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards** administer the program rather than federal EPA staff.

**Requirements for delegation** (per 40 CFR Part 123):
- State program must be equivalent to the federal program
- Must ensure compliance with all federal requirements
- Must include public participation, enforcement, and coordination provisions

**EPA oversight retained:**
- 30-day review period for each state-issued permit
- EPA can object if a permit doesn't meet federal requirements
- EPA retains direct permitting authority over certain federal facilities

### California's Institutional Structure

| Level | Authority | Primary Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| **State Water Board** | Statewide | Issues general permits (construction, industrial, pesticide); sets fees; coordinates with EPA |
| **Regional Water Boards (9)** | Geographic regions | Issues individual permits; develops Basin Plans; conducts enforcement |

The nine Regional Boards are organized by hydrological boundaries:
- Region 1: North Coast
- Region 2: San Francisco Bay
- Region 3: Central Coast
- Region 4: Los Angeles
- Region 5: Central Valley
- Region 6: Lahontan
- Region 7: Colorado River
- Region 8: Santa Ana
- Region 9: San Diego

## Types of NPDES Permits

### Individual Permits

**What they are:** Site-specific permits tailored to a particular facility's discharge characteristics.

**Characteristics:**
- Customized effluent limitations based on facility type, discharge volume, receiving water
- Full application review process with public comment
- Approximately 6+ months to issue
- 5-year maximum term

**When required:**
- Unique discharge characteristics
- Discharge to sensitive waters
- When general permit conditions aren't appropriate
- Complex treatment systems

### General Permits

**What they are:** Single permits covering multiple facilities with similar discharges.

**Characteristics:**
- Uniform conditions for all covered facilities
- Coverage obtained via Notice of Intent (NOI)
- Faster authorization (typically immediate upon NOI approval)
- 5-year permit term

**Major California General NPDES Permits:**

| Permit | Order Number | Covers |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Construction General Permit (CGP) | WQ 2022-0057-DWQ | Construction sites ≥1 acre |
| Industrial General Permit (IGP) | 2014-0057-DWQ (amended) | Industrial stormwater |
| MS4 Phase II | Statewide | Small municipal storm sewers |
| Pesticide General Permits | Various | Aquatic pesticide applications |

## NPDES vs. Waste Discharge Requirements (WDR)

Understanding when each applies is critical for compliance:

| Factor | NPDES Permit | WDR |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| **Discharge destination** | Waters of the United States (surface waters) | Land or groundwater |
| **Legal authority** | Clean Water Act (federal) | Porter-Cologne Act (state) |
| **EPA involvement** | Yes—review and oversight | No—purely state authority |
| **Examples** | Wastewater to river, stormwater to bay | Land application, percolation ponds |

**Key decision point:** If discharge is from a point source into navigable waters, NPDES is required. Discharges to land that may eventually reach groundwater typically require WDRs.

**Note:** California's Porter-Cologne Act is broader than federal law—it protects all waters including groundwater. A facility may need both NPDES (for surface water) and WDR (for land discharge) depending on operations.

## Application Process Overview

### For Individual NPDES Permits

**Step 1: Submit Application**
- California Form 200 (general information)
- Federal EPA forms (1, 2A-2F depending on facility type)
- Technical report signed by registered civil engineer
- Application fee

**Step 2: Completeness Review**
- Regional Board staff reviews for completeness
- May request additional information
- Determines if individual or general permit coverage appropriate

**Step 3: Draft Permit & Public Notice**
- Staff prepares draft permit
- 30-day public comment period
- Applicant publishes notice in local newspaper

**Step 4: Public Hearing & Board Adoption**
- Regional Board holds public hearing
- Board votes to adopt (majority required)
- May modify based on comments received

**Step 5: EPA Review**
- EPA has 30 days to review and potentially object
- If EPA objects, permit must be revised

**Step 6: Permit Effective**
- Permit takes effect after EPA review period
- Valid for up to 5 years

**Typical timeline:** 6+ months (can be longer for complex facilities)

### For General Permit Coverage

**Process:**
1. Confirm eligibility for general permit
2. Submit Notice of Intent (NOI) via SMARTS
3. Pay applicable fee
4. Receive WDID number (proof of coverage)
5. Coverage typically effective immediately

## Permit Terms and Renewal

### Duration
- Maximum 5-year permit term (per Clean Water Act)
- Must apply for renewal at least **180 days before expiration**

### Administrative Continuation
If a complete renewal application is submitted on time but the board hasn't issued a new permit by expiration, the existing permit is "administratively continued"—meaning it remains in full force and effect until the new permit is issued.

### Anti-Backsliding
The Clean Water Act prohibits permits from becoming less stringent at renewal unless specific exceptions apply. New permits must maintain or increase protections.

## Effluent Limitations Framework

NPDES permits establish two types of effluent limitations:

### Technology-Based Effluent Limitations (TBELs)
- Based on what pollution control technology can achieve
- Set by EPA through national effluent guidelines for industry categories
- Examples: Best Available Technology (BAT), Best Conventional Technology (BCT)
- For municipal wastewater: secondary treatment standard (85% removal of BOD and TSS)

### Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations (WQBELs)
- Based on protecting the receiving water's designated uses
- More stringent than technology-based if needed to meet water quality standards
- Determined through "reasonable potential analysis"
- Must protect beneficial uses (drinking water, recreation, aquatic life, etc.)

**When both apply:** The more stringent limitation controls.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need an NPDES permit or a WDR?**
A: If you discharge to surface waters (rivers, lakes, bays, ocean), you need NPDES. If you discharge to land or groundwater only, you typically need a WDR. Contact your Regional Board for specific guidance.

**Q: How long does it take to get an individual permit?**
A: Plan for 6+ months minimum. Complex facilities or contested permits can take significantly longer.

**Q: What happens if I discharge without a permit?**
A: Unauthorized discharges violate the Clean Water Act. Penalties can include administrative fines up to $10,000/day/violation and civil penalties up to $25,000/day/violation.

**Q: Can I operate while my permit renewal is pending?**
A: Yes, if you submitted a complete renewal application at least 180 days before expiration. Your existing permit is "administratively continued."
