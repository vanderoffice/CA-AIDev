**Source:** [2022 CGP Order](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/water_quality/2022/wqo_2022-0057-dwq.pdf)

### Who Must Obtain Coverage

**Applicability threshold:** Construction projects disturbing **1 acre or more** of land.

Also applies to:
- Projects < 1 acre that are part of a **larger common plan of development** totaling ≥1 acre
- Linear underground/overhead projects ≥1 acre
- Projects separated by ≤0.25 miles are considered part of the same plan

**Construction activity includes:** clearing, demolition, grading, excavation, and other land disturbance activities.

**Exemptions:**
- Routine maintenance (maintaining original line, grade, hydraulic capacity)
- Agricultural operations (disking, harrowing, soil preparation)
- Tribal lands (covered by federal permit)
- Lake Tahoe Hydrologic Unit (covered by Lahontan Regional Board permit)

### Risk Level Classification

The CGP uses a three-tiered risk system to match requirements to pollution potential:

| Risk Level | Sediment Risk | Receiving Water Risk | Requirements |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Level 1** | Low (<15 tons/acre) | Low | Basic BMPs, visual monitoring |
| **Level 2** | Medium (15-75 tons/acre) OR | High | Enhanced BMPs, sampling required |
| **Level 3** | High (≥75 tons/acre) AND | High | Most stringent BMPs, extensive sampling, weekly inspections |

**Risk calculation formula:** Watershed erosion = R × K × LS
- R = Rainfall erosivity factor
- K = Soil erodibility factor
- LS = Length-slope factor

**Important:** Risk level is set at project start and **cannot be lowered** mid-project, even after mass grading is complete.

### SWPPP Requirements

A **Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)** is required for all permitted sites.

**Must be developed by:** Qualified SWPPP Developer (QSD)
**Must be implemented by:** Qualified SWPPP Practitioner (QSP)

**Required SWPPP elements:**
- Site description and construction activity details
- Identification of all potential pollutant sources
- Erosion and sediment control BMPs
- Pollution prevention measures
- Monitoring and sampling locations
- Post-construction stormwater controls

**2022 CGP change:** Post-construction plans must now be submitted **with the initial NOI**, not at project end.

**QSD/QSP Qualification Requirements:**
1. Underlying credential (CESSWI, CA licensed engineer, landscape architect, or geologist)
2. CGP review materials completion
3. Training from CGP Trainer of Record
4. Pass QSD exam (70% or higher)

|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-storm** | Within 72 hours of forecast showing ≥50% chance of ≥0.5" rain in 24 hrs |
| **During storm** | At least once per 24-hour period during qualifying precipitation events |
| **Post-storm** | Within 96 hours after storm accumulating ≥0.5" |

**Sampling Requirements (varies by risk level):**
- Risk Level 1: Visual monitoring only (no sampling required)
- Risk Level 2: Sampling during qualifying events
- Risk Level 3: Weekly inspections + minimum 3 samples/day during extended storm events

**Reporting deadlines:**
- Field sampling results: **30 days** after precipitation event
- Exceedance results: **10 days**
- Annual Report: **September 1** (if enrolled ≥90 days during reporting year)

### TMDL Requirements

If your project discharges to a **TMDL-listed watershed**, additional requirements apply:

**Three conditions that trigger TMDL sampling:**
1. Project discharges to TMDL-listed watershed/waterbody
2. Site-specific pollutant source assessment identifies TMDL pollutant present
3. TMDL pollutant has potential to enter stormwater discharge

**Numeric Action Level (NAL) exceedances:**
- Not a permit violation itself
- **Failing to respond** to NAL exceedance IS a violation
- Must take corrective action after 2nd exceedance at same location in reporting year

**Numeric Effluent Limitation (NEL) exceedances:**
- ARE permit violations
- Subject to mandatory minimum penalties
- Must implement water quality-based corrective actions

**Zero waste load allocation TMDLs:** Must use RUSLE2 modeling to demonstrate erosion during construction ≤ pre-construction conditions.

## Industrial General Permit (IGP)

### Current Permit Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Order Number** | 2014-0057-DWQ (as amended by 2015-0122-DWQ and 2018-0028-DWQ) |
| **NPDES Number** | CAS000001 |
| **Status** | Administratively continued (expired 6/30/2020) |
| **Renewal** | Under development |

**Note:** The permit remains in full force and effect during administrative continuation. All requirements still apply.

**Source:** [Industrial General Permit](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/igp_20140057dwq.html)


### Covered Industries

Coverage required for facilities in **nine federally defined categories** of industrial activities.

**Commonly covered facility types:**
- Manufacturing facilities
- Landfills and waste management
- Mining operations
- Steam electric power generating
- Hazardous waste treatment/storage/disposal
- Transportation facilities with vehicle maintenance
- Sewage/wastewater treatment plants (≥1 MGD)
- Recycling facilities
- Oil and gas facilities

**Determined by SIC code:** Facilities are identified using **Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes** from the 1987 SIC Manual. Check Attachment A of the IGP for the complete list.

**SIC Code Resources:**
- [Alphabetic SIC List](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/sic.html)
- [Numeric SIC List](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/sicnum.html)

**Important:** Some SIC codes have footnotes limiting coverage to specific activities. Regional Boards can also require coverage if a facility is a significant pollutant contributor, even if not otherwise required.


### No Exposure Certification (NEC) Alternative

Facilities may file a **No Exposure Certification** instead of full permit coverage if **all industrial materials and activities are protected from stormwater contact**.

**Eligibility:** Must certify "no exposure" for all 11 major exposure areas:
- Loading/unloading of materials
- Storage of raw materials, intermediates, products, by-products
- Material handling equipment
- Industrial machinery
- Waste materials
- And others...

**If ANY area has exposure, NEC is not available—must obtain full NOI coverage.**

**NEC requirements:**
- Submit via SMARTS
- Annual fee: **$150**
- Annual recertification required (July 1 - October 1)
- If conditions change creating exposure, must immediately file NOI

**Source:** [NEC Industrial Guide](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/smarts/industrial/docs/no-exposure-certification-nec-industrial-guide.pdf)


### Benchmark Monitoring

The IGP requires facilities to monitor stormwater discharge against **benchmark values** to evaluate BMP effectiveness.

**Required parameters for ALL facilities:**
- Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
- Oil and Grease (O&G)
- pH

**Additional parameters:** Based on facility SIC code per IGP Table 1

**Sampling requirements:**
- Minimum **4 samples per reporting year** per discharge location
- 2 samples in first half (July 1 - December 31)
- 2 samples in second half (January 1 - June 30)
- Collected within **4 hours of discharge start**
- From **Qualified Storm Events** (preceded by ≥48 hours without discharge)

**pH measurement:** Must be measured on-site within 15 minutes of collection using calibrated meter or pH paper.

### SWPPP Requirements

All IGP-covered facilities must develop and implement a **Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan**.

**SWPPP must include:**
- Facility description and site map
- List of industrial materials exposed to stormwater
- Identification of all potential pollutant sources
- Description of BMPs (structural and operational)
- Monitoring and sampling locations
- BMP effectiveness evaluation procedures

**SWPPP submission:** Via SMARTS; keep copy at facility

**BMPs must achieve:**
- Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT)
- Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT)
