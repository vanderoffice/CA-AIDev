# WDR General Orders and Regional Variations

## Statewide General Orders

Statewide General Orders are adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board and apply uniformly across California. Dischargers enroll by submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI) to the appropriate Regional Board.

### Winery General Order (WQ 2021-0002-DWQ)

The Statewide Winery Order regulates wine and grape juice processing facilities discharging process water to land.

**Effective:** January 20, 2021

**Applies to:**
- Wineries generating 10,000+ gallons of process water annually
- Grape juice facilities
- Crush-only facilities with significant wastewater

**Does NOT cover:**
- Breweries, distilleries, cideries (need separate WDR)
- Discharges to surface water (need NPDES)
- Facilities <10,000 gal/year (exempt if meeting conditions)

#### Tier Structure

| Tier | Annual Volume | Requirements |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Exempt | <10,000 gal | No enrollment if no threat to water quality |
| Tier 1 | 10,000-30,000 gal | Basic requirements, minimal monitoring |
| Tier 2 | 30,001-300,000 gal | Moderate monitoring, BMPs required |
| Tier 3 | 300,001-1,000,000 gal | Nitrogen control plan, comprehensive monitoring |
| Tier 4 | 1,000,001-15,000,000 gal | Full monitoring, groundwater wells required |

**Constituents of Concern:**
- Nitrogen (from grape solids, yeast, cleaning chemicals)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
- Salinity (Total Dissolved Solids)

**Key Prohibitions (All Tiers):**
- No discharge to surface waters
- No discharge of untreated wastewater
- No discharge to land not owned/controlled by facility
- Must meet Basin Plan water quality objectives

**Compliance Timeline:**
- Existing wineries: NOI within 3 years of effective date
- Compliance: Within 5 years of NOI submission
- New wineries: Must enroll before commencing discharge

### Dairy General Order

Dairy operations are regulated through **regional** general orders rather than a single statewide order. However, the approach is consistent:

**Central Valley (Region 5) - General Order R5-2007-0035:**
- Covers 1,300+ dairies
- Focus on nitrogen to groundwater
- Requires Nutrient Management Plans
- Waste Management Plans required
- Annual reporting

**North Coast (Region 1) - Order R1-2019-0001:**
- Covers existing and new dairies
- Water Quality Plans required
- Riparian Management Plans for operations near streams
- Monitoring for nitrogen, pathogens

**CAFO Thresholds:**
| Classification | Mature Dairy Cows | Requirements |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Large CAFO | 700+ | Most stringent, may need NPDES if discharge to surface |
| Medium AFO | 200-699 | May be designated CAFO if discharge occurs |
| Small AFO | <200 | May still need WDR if threat exists |

### Timber Harvest General Order

Regulates nonpoint source pollution from forestry activities.

## Regional Variations

### How Regional Boards Differ

Each of California's nine Regional Boards implements WDRs based on their **Basin Plan** - the regional water quality control plan establishing:
- Beneficial uses for each water body
- Water quality objectives (numeric and narrative)
- Implementation policies
- Discharge prohibitions

### Central Valley (Region 5)

**Unique Challenges:**
- Massive irrigated agriculture (~2.36 million acres)
- Groundwater nitrate contamination
- Selenium in agricultural drainage
- Salt accumulation in closed basins

**Key Programs:**
- **Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP):** Requires all irrigated agriculture to have WDR coverage
- **Salt and Nitrate Control Program:** Limits cumulative nitrogen discharge
- **CV-SALTS:** Long-term salinity management

**Coalition Option:**
Growers can join third-party coalitions that:
- Provide technical assistance
- Coordinate regional monitoring
- Submit collective reports
- Reduce individual compliance burden

### Lahontan (Region 6)

**Unique Characteristics:**
- High elevation basins and alpine lakes
- Sensitive ecosystems (Lake Tahoe, Mono Lake)
- Desert groundwater basins
- Limited assimilative capacity

**Stricter Requirements:**
- Lake Tahoe watershed has nation's strictest discharge prohibitions
- Zero discharge often required near sensitive water bodies
- Enhanced sediment control for construction

### San Francisco Bay (Region 2)

**Focus Areas:**
- Complex estuary management
- Urban runoff
- Legacy industrial contamination
- Bay fill restrictions

**Notable:**
- Extensive NPDES program (more surface water than land discharge)
- PCB and mercury TMDL implementation
- Integrated watershed management

### North Coast (Region 1)

**Priorities:**
- Salmonid habitat protection
- Sediment control from timber/roads
- Temperature management
- Cannabis cultivation impacts

**Programs:**
- Timber waiver/general order system
- Dairy general order (coastal watersheds)
- Cannabis general order implementation

### Los Angeles (Region 4)

**Characteristics:**
- Densely urban
- Limited receiving water capacity
- Aggressive MS4 stormwater program
- Heavy industrial history

**Requirements:**
- Some strictest stormwater permits in state
- TMDLs for metals, bacteria, trash
- Enhanced monitoring requirements

## Eligibility: General Order vs Individual WDR

### You CAN Use a General Order If:

1. **Activity matches** a covered category
2. **Volume/size within thresholds** (see tier structures above)
3. **Location not disqualified** (not in prohibited area)
4. **No disqualifying factors:**
   - Hazardous waste
   - Human sewage (for low-threat orders)
   - Previous compliance problems
   - Unique site conditions requiring custom protections

### You NEED an Individual WDR If:

1. **Exceeds general order thresholds**
   - Winery >15 million gal/year
   - Domestic system >100,000 gpd

2. **Site-specific conditions warrant custom requirements**
   - Shallow groundwater
   - Proximity to drinking water wells
   - Sensitive habitat nearby
   - Existing contamination

3. **Cumulative impacts concern**
   - Multiple similar dischargers in watershed
   - Regional Board determines general conditions insufficient

4. **Innovative/unusual treatment**
   - Novel technology not addressed in general order
   - Non-standard disposal method

5. **Regional Board determination**
   - Executive Officer can require individual permit
   - Even if technically eligible for general order

### Decision Tree

```
Is there a General Order for your activity type?
├── NO → Apply for Individual WDR (Form 200)
└── YES → Does your discharge meet ALL eligibility criteria?
    ├── NO → Apply for Individual WDR
    └── YES → Are there site-specific concerns?
        ├── YES → Consult Regional Board; may need Individual WDR
        └── NO → Submit Notice of Intent for General Order
```
