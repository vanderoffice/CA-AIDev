# Waste Discharge Requirements (WDR) Overview

## What Are WDRs?

Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) are California-specific permits that regulate discharges **not covered by federal NPDES permits**. While NPDES permits handle discharges to surface waters, WDRs regulate discharges to:

- Land (land application areas, evaporation ponds)
- Groundwater (percolation, injection wells)
- Waters not subject to federal jurisdiction (isolated wetlands, certain ephemeral streams)

WDRs are issued under the **Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act** (California Water Code Division 7), which predates and in many ways exceeds federal Clean Water Act authority.

## WDR vs NPDES: When Each Applies

| Discharge Destination | Permit Type | Authority |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Surface waters (rivers, lakes, ocean) | NPDES | Federal CWA + State |
| Publicly Owned Treatment Works (sewer) | None required* | Local pretreatment |
| Land application | WDR | State only |
| Groundwater (injection, percolation) | WDR | State only |
| Evaporation ponds | WDR | State only |
| Isolated wetlands | WDR | State only |

*Discharging to a sewer system means the POTW holds the NPDES permit

### Key Distinction
- **NPDES** = discharges TO surface water
- **WDR** = discharges that MAY AFFECT water quality (land, groundwater)

Many facilities need **both** permits if they have multiple waste streams (e.g., stormwater to surface water AND process water to land).

## Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act

Enacted in 1969, Porter-Cologne is California's foundational water quality law. Key principles:

1. **All waters of the state must be protected** (broader than federal "waters of the US")
2. **Highest water quality reasonable** must be achieved
3. **Discharge is a privilege**, not a right - subject to state conditions
4. **Both point and nonpoint sources** are regulated

Porter-Cologne created:
- State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB)
- Nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs)
- Basin Plan system for water quality objectives
- WDR permitting authority

## Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD) Application

### Form 200 - The Standard Application

Anyone proposing to discharge waste that could affect water quality must file a **Report of Waste Discharge** using Form 200. Required information:

**Facility Information:**
- Applicant name and contact information
- Facility location and Assessor's Parcel Number
- Reason for filing (new discharge, change, ownership transfer, renewal)

**Discharge Characterization:**
- All waste sources and volumes
- Chemical composition and concentrations
- Discharge frequency and duration
- Ultimate destination (land, evaporation pond, injection well)

**Site Documentation:**
- USGS 7.5-minute topographic map or detailed site map
- Treatment systems and monitoring well locations
- Groundwater depth and flow direction
- Proximity to domestic wells and surface water
- Soil types in application areas

**Environmental Review:**
- CEQA documentation (or exemption basis)
- For existing discharges, most receive categorical exemptions

### Application Timeline

| Stage | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| Completeness determination | 30 days from submission |
| Request for supplemental info | If incomplete, 30 days to respond |
| Substantive review begins | When complete |
| Individual WDR processing | 6-12+ months typical |
| General Order NOI processing | 30-60 days typical |

## Regional Board Jurisdiction

California's nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards issue WDRs based on **hydrological boundaries**, not county lines:

| Region | Name | Key Areas |
|--------|------|-----------|
| 1 | North Coast | Del Norte to Marin, inland to Glenn/Modoc |
| 2 | San Francisco Bay | Bay Area, Napa, Solano |
| 3 | Central Coast | Santa Cruz to Santa Barbara |
| 4 | Los Angeles | LA, Ventura counties |
| 5 | Central Valley | Sacramento/San Joaquin valleys |
| 6 | Lahontan | Eastern Sierra, high desert |
| 7 | Colorado River | Imperial, eastern Riverside/San Bernardino |
| 8 | Santa Ana | Orange County, western Riverside/San Bernardino |
| 9 | San Diego | San Diego County |

**Regional Boards are responsible for:**
- Adopting Basin Plans (water quality objectives)
- Issuing WDRs and NPDES permits
- Conducting inspections and enforcement
- Implementing TMDLs

## General WDRs vs Individual WDRs

### General WDRs (General Orders)
Standardized permits for categories of similar discharges. Dischargers enroll via **Notice of Intent (NOI)** rather than full application.

**Advantages:**
- Faster processing (30-60 days)
- Lower application burden
- Consistent requirements statewide or regionwide
- Lower fees typically

**Eligibility requires:**
- Same or similar operations
- Same or similar waste types
- Same treatment standards appropriate
- General requirements protective

### Individual WDRs
Site-specific permits for discharges that cannot fit general orders.

**Required when:**
- Discharge exceeds general order thresholds
- Site conditions require custom protections
- Multiple similar dischargers create cumulative impacts
- Innovative treatment proposed
- Located in sensitive areas

**Process involves:**
- Full Form 200 application
- Public notice and comment period
- Potentially public hearing
- Board adoption required

## Monitoring and Reporting Requirements

### Discharge Monitoring
- Effluent sampling at treatment system outfall
- Frequency based on permit tier (monthly to annually)
- Parameters: BOD, TSS, nitrogen, pathogens, pH, etc.

### Groundwater Monitoring
- Upgradient and downgradient monitoring wells
- Quarterly to annual sampling typical
- Compare to background levels and water quality objectives

### Reporting Requirements
| Report Type | Frequency | Contents |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Self-monitoring reports | Per permit | Lab results, operational data |
| Annual reports | Yearly | Comprehensive summary, trends |
| Violation reports | Within 24 hours | Immediate notification required |

All reports submitted via **CIWQS** (California Integrated Water Quality System).

## Common WDR Categories

### Wastewater Disposal to Land
- Food processing wastewater
- Winery process water
- Industrial cooling water
- Treated municipal wastewater (recycled water)

### Landfills and Waste Facilities
- Municipal solid waste landfills
- Industrial waste disposal sites
- Composting facilities
- Transfer stations

### Mining Operations
- Aggregate processing
- Mineral extraction
- Mine dewatering
- Tailings management

### Agricultural Operations
- Irrigated agriculture (nitrogen, pesticides, salts)
- Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs)
- Dairy operations
- Food processing

### Onsite Wastewater Systems
- Septic systems (1.2 million+ in California)
- Small package treatment plants
- Cluster systems
- Advanced treatment systems

## Fee Schedule (FY 2025-26)

### Annual Fees (Examples)
| Discharge Type | Fee Range |
|----------------|-----------|
| Small domestic (<50,000 gpd) | 50% discount applies |
| Industrial wastewater | Based on volume/complexity |
| Winery Tier 1 (10K-30K gal/yr) | ~$889 |
| Winery Tier 4 (1M-15M gal/yr) | ~$3,540+ |
| Agricultural operations | Based on acreage/intensity |
| CAFO | Based on animal units |

### Application Fees
- Initial application: $500-$5,000+ depending on complexity
- Project fees for dredge/fill: Based on disturbed area
- NOI for general orders: Typically lower than individual

### Fee Adjustments
- Annual fees may change with State Board budget
- Some categories receive discounts
- Non-payment can result in permit termination

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Administrative Actions
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Notice of Violation | Document non-compliance |
| Cease and Desist Order | Stop unauthorized discharge |
| Cleanup and Abatement Order | Require remediation |
| Administrative Civil Liability | Monetary penalties |

### Escalation Path
1. Informal notice → corrective action
2. Formal NOV → documented violation
3. ACL → monetary penalties (can be significant)
4. Civil court action → injunctions, larger penalties
5. Criminal referral → knowing/willful violations

### Discharger Obligations
- Maintain facilities in proper operating condition
- Implement required BMPs
- Report violations within 24 hours
- Maintain monitoring equipment calibration
- Keep records for regulatory inspection

## Key Takeaways for Water Bot Users

1. **If you discharge to land or groundwater, you need a WDR** (not NPDES)
2. **Check for applicable General Orders first** - faster, simpler enrollment
3. **Regional Board matters** - requirements vary by location
4. **Porter-Cologne covers more than federal law** - even "isolated" waters
5. **Start early** - individual WDRs can take 6-12+ months
6. **Document everything** - monitoring and recordkeeping are critical
