# Section 401 Water Quality Certification

## What Is 401 Certification?

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act gives California the power to review and condition any federal permit or license that may result in a discharge to waters of the United States. No federal agency can issue such permits without state certification that the project will comply with water quality standards.

**Key principle:** If your project needs a federal permit AND may discharge to waters, you need 401 certification from California.

## When Is 401 Certification Required?

401 certification is triggered when ALL of these apply:

1. A **federal license or permit** is required
2. The activity **may result in a discharge** to waters of the United States
3. The discharge would **originate in California**

### Common Federal Permits That Trigger 401

| Federal Permit | Agency | Typical Projects |
|----------------|--------|------------------|
| Section 404 permit | Army Corps of Engineers | Wetland fill, stream crossings, development affecting waters |
| FERC hydropower license | FERC | Dams, powerhouses, water diversions for energy |
| Rivers and Harbors Act (Sections 9/10) | Army Corps of Engineers | Bridge construction, piers, dredging in navigable waters |
| Bridge permit | Coast Guard | Bridge construction and modification |
| NPDES permit (federal facilities) | EPA | Point source discharges from federal installations |

### Section 404 Permits (Most Common)

Section 404 permits for dredge and fill activities are the most frequent 401 trigger. These include:
- Filling wetlands for development
- Stream channelization or relocation
- Levee and dam construction
- Highway and road construction affecting waters
- Mining operations in or near waters
- Utility line crossings

## California's Certification Authority

California can:

1. **Grant certification** - Project proceeds with any conditions imposed
2. **Grant with conditions** - Conditions become part of the federal permit
3. **Deny certification** - Federal permit cannot be issued
4. **Waive certification** - Project proceeds without state conditions

### Types of Conditions California Can Impose

- Minimum stream flow requirements
- Water temperature limits
- Sediment and erosion control measures
- Construction timing windows (e.g., avoiding fish spawning seasons)
- Monitoring and reporting requirements
- Compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts
- Adaptive management protocols
- Dam modification or removal requirements

**Important:** Certification conditions become binding requirements of the federal permit and must be enforced by the federal agency.

## Which California Agency Handles Your 401?

| Project Type | California Agency |
|--------------|-------------------|
| FERC hydropower licenses | State Water Board - Division of Water Rights |
| Water appropriations/diversions | State Water Board - Division of Water Rights |
| Multi-regional projects | State Water Board - Division of Water Quality |
| All other projects | Regional Water Quality Control Board (based on project location) |

## Application Process

### Step 1: Pre-Filing Meeting (Required)

You **must** request a pre-filing meeting with the appropriate Water Board at least **30 days** before submitting your application.

Purpose of pre-filing meeting:
- Discuss project details and potential water quality impacts
- Identify required information and studies
- Understand applicable water quality standards
- Determine if your project qualifies for a general order
- Clarify mitigation expectations

### Step 2: Submit Complete Application

Required application elements:
- Completed application form with certification statement
- Documentation of pre-filing meeting request
- Full project description with engineering plans
- Impact assessment at each discharge location
- List of all other required permits (federal, state, local)
- CEQA documentation (draft or final)
- Proposed mitigation measures
- Fee payment

### Step 3: Completeness Determination

Water Board staff have **30 days** to determine if your application is complete. If incomplete, you'll receive a request for additional information.

### Step 4: Public Notice

A minimum **21-day public notice period** is required before the Water Board can act on your application.

### Step 5: Decision

The Water Board must act within the established reasonable period of time (generally 6 months, never exceeding 1 year).

## Timeline Rules

### The One-Year Rule

The Clean Water Act requires certification decisions within **one year** of receiving a complete request. If the state fails to act within this period, certification is deemed waived.

### Reasonable Period of Time

- The MOU between California Water Boards and Army Corps establishes **6 months** as the default reasonable period
- Extensions are possible for complex projects or public notice requirements
- Total time can never exceed one year

### What Starts the Clock?

The timeline begins when the Water Board receives a **complete** certification request that includes all required elements. An incomplete application does not start the clock.

## Recent Regulatory Changes

### 2020 EPA Rule (Narrowed State Authority)

The Trump administration's 2020 rule limited state review to water quality impacts from "the discharge" only, excluding broader project impacts. This rule was vacated by a California federal court in October 2021.

### 2023 EPA Rule (Restored Authority)

The Biden administration's 2023 rule (effective November 2023) allows states to consider water quality impacts from "the activity subject to the federal license or permit," including construction and operation impacts.

### January 2026 Proposed Rule

A new proposed rule would again narrow state authority back toward the 2020 approach, limiting review to "point source discharges" rather than the broader project activity. Public comment period is open.

### California's Response

California maintains broader state authority under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, which applies to "waters of the state" - a definition that includes waters no longer covered by federal jurisdiction after the Supreme Court's 2023 Sackett decision.

## Denial of Certification

California can deny 401 certification if:
- The project would violate state water quality standards
- Insufficient information to demonstrate compliance
- Proposed mitigation is inadequate
- Impacts to beneficial uses cannot be addressed

**Consequence:** If California denies certification, the federal permit **cannot be issued**. This gives California effective veto power over federally-permitted projects.

### Notable California Denials

- **Sites Reservoir Project (September 2024):** Denied due to insufficient information demonstrating compliance with water quality requirements
- Multiple hydropower project certifications set aside in 2024 for reconsideration

## Fees

California assesses fees based on discharge type:

| Discharge Type | Fee Components |
|----------------|----------------|
| Fill and excavation | Application fee + project fee (based on impact area) + annual fee |
| Dredging | Application fee + annual fee (based on volume in cubic yards) |
| Sand mining | Flat application + annual fees |
| Restoration projects | Reduced flat fees |
| Emergency projects | Flat fees under general order |

## General Orders (Streamlined Certification)

For routine, low-impact projects, California has adopted general orders that provide pre-approved certification conditions:

- **Nationwide Permits:** Regional Water Boards issue general certifications for projects under Army Corps Nationwide Permits
- **Restoration Projects:** Statewide general order for ecological restoration (adopted August 2022)
- **Emergency Repair:** General order for emergency protection activities
- **Wildfire Mitigation:** General order for defensible space and fuel reduction

Projects qualifying under a general order can file a **Notice of Intent** rather than an individual application, significantly streamlining the process.
