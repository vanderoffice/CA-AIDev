# Federal Nexus and Agency Coordination for 401 Certification

## Determining Federal Nexus

A "federal nexus" exists when your project requires a federal license or permit. No federal nexus means no 401 certification requirement - though you may still need state permits under California's Porter-Cologne Act.

### Does Your Project Have Federal Nexus?

Ask these questions:

1. **Will you discharge dredged or fill material into waters?**
   - If yes → Likely need Section 404 permit from Army Corps → 401 required

2. **Will you build or modify a hydropower facility?**
   - If yes → Need FERC license → 401 required

3. **Will you construct or modify a bridge over navigable waters?**
   - If yes → Need Coast Guard permit → 401 required

4. **Will you build structures in navigable waters?**
   - If yes → Need Rivers and Harbors Act permit → 401 required

5. **Are the affected waters "Waters of the United States"?**
   - If no → No federal nexus, but state permits may apply

## Waters of the United States (WOTUS) After Sackett

The Supreme Court's **Sackett v. EPA** decision (May 2023) dramatically narrowed federal jurisdiction.

### Current WOTUS Definition

Federal jurisdiction now covers only:

1. **Traditional navigable waters** - Rivers, lakes, oceans used in interstate commerce
2. **Relatively permanent waters** - Standing or continuously flowing bodies forming geographic features (streams, rivers, lakes)
3. **Wetlands with continuous surface connection** - Must physically abut jurisdictional waters (touching, not just nearby)

### What's NO Longer Federally Jurisdictional

- Wetlands connected only through groundwater
- Wetlands separated from jurisdictional waters by berms, roads, or breaks
- Ephemeral streams (flow only during/after rain)
- Isolated wetlands without surface connection to navigable waters
- Waters with only "significant nexus" to navigable waters

### March 2025 EPA/Army Corps Clarification

"Continuous surface connection" means **abutting (touching)**. A wetland must physically touch a relatively permanent water body to be federally jurisdictional.

### Practical Impact

Many waters that previously required Section 404 permits (and thus 401 certification) are now outside federal jurisdiction. However:

- These waters remain **waters of the state** under California law
- You may still need **Waste Discharge Requirements** from California
- California's wetland definition is broader than the federal definition

## Jurisdictional Determination Process

### Getting a Jurisdictional Determination from the Army Corps

Before investing in permit applications, request a **jurisdictional determination** from the Army Corps:

1. **Preliminary JD** - Assumes federal jurisdiction without definitive determination
2. **Approved JD** - Official determination of whether waters are jurisdictional

An Approved JD is valid for 5 years and provides certainty about whether Section 404 applies.

### Where Federal Jurisdiction Ends, State Begins

| Water Type | Federal 404 + 401? | State WDR? |
|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Traditional navigable waters | Yes | Yes |
| Permanent tributaries | Yes | Yes |
| Wetlands touching jurisdictional waters | Yes | Yes |
| Ephemeral streams | No | Yes |
| Isolated wetlands | No | Yes |
| Groundwater-connected wetlands | No | Yes |
| Historic WOTUS (pre-Sackett) | No | Yes |

## Coordination with Army Corps of Engineers

### MOU Between Water Boards and Corps

California Water Boards maintain a **Memorandum of Understanding** with the Sacramento, Los Angeles, and San Francisco Districts of the Army Corps. Key provisions:

**Joint Pre-Application Meetings:**
- Either agency can invite the other to pre-application meetings
- Joint meetings encouraged for complex projects
- Corps copies Water Board on "no permit required" determinations

**Concurrent Applications:**
- Submit 401 certification request **at the same time** as 404 permit application
- Don't wait for Corps to process before applying to Water Board

**Coordinated Timelines:**
- Water Board must confirm receipt within 30 days
- Default reasonable period is 6 months
- Extensions possible with Corps agreement
- Total time cannot exceed 1 year

**Decision Sharing:**
- Water Board sends certification decision to Corps within 3 days
- Corps can request reconsideration of specific certification aspects
- Water Board must respond in writing to reconsideration requests

### Tips for Applicants

1. **Request joint meetings** - Get both agencies in the room at once
2. **Submit concurrently** - File 401 and 404 applications together
3. **Use Corps public notice** - 401 notice can run during Corps comment period
4. **Get JD first** - Clarify jurisdiction before investing in applications

## Coordination with FERC for Hydropower

### FERC's Section 401 Requirements

FERC adopted updated 401 requirements in May 2024:

- **One-year deadline** applies categorically to all FERC proceedings
- States should ideally act within **6 months**
- Requirement extends to license exemptions, amendments, and surrenders
- Small hydro projects (≤10 MW) now explicitly covered

### Which California Agency?

All FERC-licensed projects go to the **State Water Board - Division of Water Rights**.

### FERC-Specific Timeline

| Action | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| Submit 401 request to State Water Board | With or before FERC application |
| File copy of 401 request with FERC | Within 60 days of FERC application (Part 7 expedited) |
| State Water Board decision | Within 6 months (ideal) to 1 year (maximum) |

### Withdrawal and Resubmission (No Longer Permitted)

Historically, applicants would withdraw and resubmit 401 requests just before the 1-year deadline to restart the clock. Recent court decisions and the 2026 proposed rule address this:

- FERC may find waiver if withdrawal/resubmission appears coordinated to delay
- 2026 proposed rule would prohibit requesting withdrawal/resubmission before deadline
- Better practice: Ensure application is complete and work with State Water Board early

## Joint Application Strategies

### Best Practices for Multi-Permit Projects

**For Projects Affecting Wetlands:**

| Permit/Authorization | Agency | Submit When |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| Section 404 permit | Army Corps | Day 1 |
| 401 certification | Regional/State Water Board | Day 1 (concurrent) |
| 1602 Agreement | CA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife | Before or concurrent |
| ESA Section 7 consultation | USFWS or NMFS | Triggered by 404 application |

**For Bridge Projects:**

| Permit/Authorization | Agency | Submit When |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| Bridge permit | Coast Guard | Day 1 |
| Section 404 permit (if fill involved) | Army Corps | Day 1 (concurrent) |
| 401 certification | Regional/State Water Board | Cover both federal permits |
| Rivers and Harbors Section 10 | Army Corps | If applicable |

### Addressing Multiple Federal Permits in One 401

Your 401 certification request should:

1. List **all** federal permits the project requires
2. Identify each federal agency involved
3. Request certification cover all applicable federal authorizations
4. Include all agencies in pre-filing meetings

**Coast Guard Advisory (September 2024):** Ensure your 401 lists all federal permits. A certification issued only for Section 404 doesn't automatically cover the Coast Guard bridge permit.

## Timeline Coordination

### Aligning Federal and State Timelines

```
Federal Permit Timeline
├── Application submitted to Army Corps
├── Corps issues public notice (30 days)
├── Corps reviews and evaluates
└── Corps issues permit (after 401 received)

State 401 Timeline
├── Pre-filing meeting request (30 days before application)
├── 401 application submitted (same day as 404)
├── Completeness determination (30 days)
├── Public notice (21 days, can overlap with Corps notice)
├── Water Board review and decision (up to 6 months)
└── Certification issued

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Key: Corps cannot issue 404 permit until 401 is granted or waived
```

### When Timelines Don't Align

If 401 review is taking longer than 404 review:

1. **Corps waits** - They cannot issue the permit without 401
2. **Request extension** - Water Board can request more time from Corps
3. **Monitor the clock** - Track your 1-year deadline carefully

## Waiver of 401 Certification

### Express Waiver

The Water Board may expressly waive 401 if:
- Project will comply with water quality requirements, or
- Activity won't result in discharge to waters of the United States

Must be in writing to applicant and federal agency.

### Implied Waiver (Failure to Act)

If the Water Board fails to act within the reasonable period of time (max 1 year), certification is deemed waived:
- Federal agency may proceed without certification
- State cannot later impose conditions under Section 401
- **But:** California may still require Waste Discharge Requirements

### Waiver Doesn't Eliminate State Authority

Even if 401 is waived:
- Porter-Cologne requirements may still apply
- Waste Discharge Requirements may be needed
- California wetland procedures may apply
- State can regulate under its own authority

## California-Specific Jurisdiction Issues

### State vs. Regional Board Authority

| Situation | Authority |
|-----------|-----------|
| FERC hydropower license | State Water Board - Division of Water Rights |
| Water appropriation/diversion | State Water Board - Division of Water Rights |
| Project in one region | Regional Water Board |
| Project crosses regional boundaries | State Water Board - Division of Water Quality |

### California's Broader Wetland Definition

California's State Wetland Definition (effective May 2020):
- Broader than federal definition
- Covers all current and historic WOTUS
- Covers isolated wetlands outside federal jurisdiction
- Implements "no net loss" policy

**Result:** Activities outside federal jurisdiction may still require:
- Waste Discharge Requirements
- Compliance with California Wetland Procedures
- Mitigation under state law

## Recent Examples and Issues

### Battle Creek Hydroelectric Project (March 2024)

- **Type:** FERC license amendment for dam removal
- **Agency:** State Water Board - Division of Water Rights
- **Action:** 401 certification granted for Inskip Diversion Dam removal
- **Lesson:** Dam removal requires 401 for the removal activities themselves

### Multiple Hydropower Certifications Set Aside (May 2024)

- **Projects:** 5 major hydropower projects (Merced, Yuba-Bear, Don Pedro, La Grange)
- **Action:** State Water Board set aside 2020-2021 certifications
- **Lesson:** Certifications can be revisited if conditions change or were inadequate

### Sites Reservoir (September 2024)

- **Action:** 401 certification denied
- **Reason:** Insufficient information to demonstrate water quality compliance
- **Lesson:** Comprehensive documentation is essential; denial blocks the project
