# Habitat Restoration Permits

California has developed streamlined permitting pathways specifically for habitat restoration projects. These accelerated approaches reduce timelines by an average of 7 months and save millions in combined staff time and consultant fees compared to traditional individual permits.

## Why Restoration Permits Matter

Standard permits can take 6-12+ months. Restoration-specific orders recognize that projects creating ecological benefits deserve faster, cheaper authorization than projects causing environmental impacts.

## Key Permitting Pathways

### Statewide Restoration General Order (SRGO)

**Order WQ 2022-0048-DWQ** — Adopted August 16, 2022

The SRGO provides unified Clean Water Act Section 401 certification and Porter-Cologne Act Waste Discharge Requirements for restoration projects that exceed small project thresholds.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Must result in **net increase** in aquatic/riparian resource functions
- Comply with applicable water quality control plans
- Not cause long-term disruption of aquatic life movement
- Not eliminate riffle-pool complexes (unless replaced/enhanced elsewhere)

**Ineligible activities:**
- Projects using chemically treated timbers in/near waters
- Water diversions (except for water conservation, managed wetlands, or temporary dewatering)
- Infiltration galleries without volitional fish movement

**10 Eligible Project Types:**
1. Stream crossing/fish passage improvements
2. Small dam, tide gate, flood gate removal
3. Bioengineered streambank stabilization (native vegetation/wood)
4. Off-channel and side-channel habitat restoration
5. Water conservation projects improving aquatic habitat
6. Floodplain restoration
7. Piling/in-water structure removal
8. Invasive species removal + native revegetation
9. Tidal, subtidal, and freshwater wetland establishment/restoration
10. Stream and riparian habitat restoration in upslope areas

**Application Process:**
1. **Pre-application consultation** (recommended 30+ days before NOI)
2. **Submit Notice of Intent (NOI)** to Regional Water Board
   - Copy to State Board at stateboard401@waterboards.ca.gov
   - Include project description, maps, baseline conditions, protection measures
3. **Completeness review** (30 days)
4. **Public notice and 21-day comment period**
5. **Notice of Applicability (NOA)** issued if project qualifies
6. **Timeline:** 30-60 days typical (vs. 6-12+ months for individual permits)

**Monitoring and Reporting:**
- Project-specific requirements in NOA
- Annual reports within 1 month of NOA anniversary
- Request Notice of Project Complete within 30 days of project completion

### General Order for Small Habitat Restoration Projects

**For projects ≤5 acres or ≤500 linear feet**

Provides streamlined Section 401 certification for small-scale restoration that qualifies for CEQA Categorical Exemption 15333.

**Eligible Project Types:**
- Native plant revegetation of disturbed areas
- Wetland restoration for waterfowl/wildlife
- Stream/river bank revegetation for amphibians/native fish
- Hand-labor habitat restoration/enhancement
- Bioengineered bank stabilization
- Culvert replacement per CDFW/NOAA guidelines

**Key Requirements:**
- Must meet CEQA categorical exemption criteria
- No significant adverse impacts to endangered/rare/threatened species
- No hazardous materials disturbance

**Application Process:**
1. Submit NOI at least **30 days before** project start
2. Regional Water Board issues NOA or Notice of Exclusion within 30 days
3. If no response in 30 days, project may proceed

**Size Limits:**
| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Total project area | ≤5 acres |
| Stream bank/coastline | ≤500 linear feet |

## Accelerated Pathways

### Statutory Exemption for Restoration Projects (SERP)

**Public Resources Code §21080.56** — Extended through January 1, 2030 (SB 174, 2024)

CEQA exemption for restoration projects meeting specific criteria—removes size limitations that constrained large-scale restoration.

**Requirements:**
- Creates/restores habitat for CA native fish and wildlife
- Results in long-term net benefits to climate resiliency, biodiversity, sensitive species recovery
- Subject to all other applicable laws

**Process:**
1. Lead agency determines SERP applies (substantial evidence)
2. Submit request to CDFW for Director's written concurrence
3. CDFW aims for 60-day response
4. File Notice of Exemption within 48 hours of project approval

### Restoration Management Permit (RMP)

**CDFW pilot program launched January 2025**

Consolidates up to **5 separate CDFW authorizations** into one permit:
1. CESA take authorization (threatened/endangered/candidate species)
2. Fully Protected Species take authorization
3. Native Plant Protection Act rare plant authorization
4. Other native species take authorization
5. Lake and Streambed Alteration (§1602) authorization

**Eligibility:**
- Primary purpose must be restoration
- Must result in "substantial net benefits" above baseline
- Secondary benefits (flood reduction, recreation) allowed

**Application:**
- Comprehensive project information
- Baseline conditions
- Protection measures
- Monitoring and reporting plans

**Timeline:** CDFW aims for 120-day issuance

**Cost:** Currently no application fee during pilot

### Habitat Restoration and Enhancement Act (HREA)

**Fish and Game Code §1652-1653**

Streamlined simultaneous LSA and CESA authorization for small restoration projects.

**Two pathways:**

| Section | Timeline | Requirements |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| §1653 | 30 days | Must have Water Board small project NOA first |
| §1652 | 60 days | Broader eligibility |

### Fisheries Restoration Grant Program (FRGP)

CDFW-funded projects receive automatic programmatic permit coverage:
- Section 401 certification (Water Board)
- Section 404 authorization (Army Corps RGP)
- Projects meeting CA Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual qualify

## Multi-Agency Coordination

Restoration projects often require authorization from multiple agencies. California has developed coordinated frameworks:

### CDFW Lake and Streambed Alteration (§1600)

**Required for:** Activities that divert/obstruct flow, change bed/channel/bank, or deposit material in streams/lakes.

**Coordination:** HREA and RMP provide streamlined alternatives to individual LSA agreements.

### Army Corps Section 404

**Required for:** Dredge/fill discharges to waters of the U.S.

**Key programs:**
- **Nationwide Permit 27:** Aquatic habitat restoration/enhancement
- **Regional General Permit 16 (Sacramento District):** Restoration activities

**Coordination:** SRGO provides Section 401 certification for Corps-authorized projects.

### Section 408 (Rivers and Harbors Act)

**Required for:** Modifications to federal flood control or navigation facilities (levees, dams, channels).

**Process:** Concurrent with Section 404/401, coordinate between Corps Regulatory Division and Civil Works Division.

### NMFS Programmatic Biological Opinions

**Coverage:** Anadromous fish species (salmon, steelhead, sturgeon) under ESA Section 7

**Regional PBOs available for:**
- North Coast
- Central Coast
- South Coast
- Central Valley/Delta

**Benefit:** Pre-approved species protection measures eliminate individual project consultations.

### USFWS Statewide Restoration PBO (2022)

**Coverage:** 68 species with Likely to Adversely Affect determinations, 11 with Not Likely to Adversely Affect—total 72 species.

**Eligible federal action agencies:**
- Army Corps
- NOAA Restoration Center
- NOAA Office for Coastal Management
- USFWS
- Bureau of Reclamation
- Other agencies can join as "late arriving lead action agencies"

**Tools:** Use Protection Measures Selection Tool (Sustainable Conservation) to identify applicable measures.

### Coastal Commission

**Required for:** Projects in California's coastal zone

**Streamlined options:**
- De minimis waiver for low-impact activities
- Master permit frameworks
- Federal Consistency Determinations for programmatic approval

## Fee Comparison
