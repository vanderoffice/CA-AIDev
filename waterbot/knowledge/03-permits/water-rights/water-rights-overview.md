# California Water Rights System

Understanding water rights in California is essential for anyone managing water resources. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Division of Water Rights administers one of the most complex water allocation systems in the United States.

## Why Water Rights Matter

California operates a dual system recognizing both land-based riparian rights and time-based appropriative rights. This framework determines who can use water, how much, and when—critical knowledge for agricultural operations, municipal suppliers, and environmental protection.

## Types of Water Rights

### Riparian Rights

**What they are:** Rights arising from ownership of land adjacent to a natural water source (stream, river, lake).

**Key characteristics:**
- No permit required—rights attach automatically to riparian land
- Limited to natural flow (cannot store water for dry seasons)
- Cannot use water outside the natural watershed
- Correlative sharing during shortages (all riparian users share proportionally)
- Cannot be sold separately from the land

**Limitations:**
- If land is subdivided so portions no longer touch the watercourse, those parcels lose riparian rights
- All use must still be "reasonable and beneficial" per California Constitution Article X, Section 2

### Post-1914 Appropriative Rights

**What they are:** Permitted rights administered by the State Water Board for diversions that began after December 19, 1914.

**Key characteristics:**
- Requires formal permit and license from SWRCB
- Priority based on application date ("first in time, first in right")
- Can be quantified, transferred, and used outside watershed
- Subject to all permit terms and conditions
- Can be forfeited through five years of non-use

**Two-phase process:**
1. **Permit phase:** Authorizes project development with conditions
2. **License phase:** Confirms beneficial use; becomes permanent right

### Pre-1914 Appropriative Rights

**What they are:** Water uses that commenced before December 19, 1914—the date the permit system began.

**Key characteristics:**
- No permit required (vested rights)
- Greater flexibility to change place/purpose of use without Board approval
- Still subject to reasonable and beneficial use requirement
- Burden of proving injury falls on party claiming injury

**Recent changes (SB 389, 2023):**
- State Board now has investigative and enforcement authority over pre-1914 rights
- Can issue information orders requiring documentation
- Can make findings of forfeiture even without conflicting claims

### Pueblo Rights

**What they are:** Special rights held by California cities that are successors to Spanish or Mexican pueblos.

**Key characteristics:**
- Paramount rights to all needed surface and subsurface water from entire watershed
- Senior to both riparian and appropriative rights
- Must be used within modern city limits
- Increase with population growth and annexation

**Examples:** Los Angeles and San Diego have established pueblo rights.

### Prescriptive Rights

**What they are:** Rights acquired through long-term unauthorized use (similar to adverse possession).

**Requirements to establish:**
- Continuous, open, notorious use
- Hostile to rights of existing users
- At least five years of such use

**Current status:** Largely restricted for surface water since 1914 permit system. Still possible for groundwater in overdrafted basins under specialized circumstances.

## Water Right Permit Process

### Application Requirements

1. **File Application to Appropriate Water**
   - Source identification
   - Place of use
   - Purpose of use
   - Point(s) of diversion
   - Maximum quantity (acre-feet/year)
   - Filing fee

2. **Establish priority date** (date application received)

3. **Division review** (30 days for completeness determination)

### Current Fees (FY 2024-2025)

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Application fee | $275 + $0.10/AF over 10 AF |
| DFW review (≥1,000 AF) | $3,000-$5,000 + $0.10/AF |
| Annual permit/license | $350 + $0.12/AF over 10 AF |
| Change petition (§1707) | $850 |
| Transfer petition | $2,000 + $0.50/AF |

### Water Availability Analysis

Before permit issuance, applicants must demonstrate:
- Unappropriated water exists to supply the request
- After accounting for senior rights and environmental needs
- Typically includes water supply report and cumulative diversion analysis

The State Board has developed specific methodologies for different watersheds (Russian River, Dry Creek, Delta).

### Environmental Review (CEQA)

All applications require CEQA compliance:
- **Large projects:** Full Environmental Impact Report (often 1+ years)
- **Smaller projects:** Mitigated Negative Declaration
- Must consider public trust resources (fisheries, navigation, recreation)

### Public Notice and Protest Period

1. **Public notice published** after application acceptance
2. **Protest period** allows affected parties to object
3. **Protest requirements** (Title 23 CCR §745):
   - Demonstrate interest
   - Allege specific injury
   - State basis of claim and when use commenced

4. **Resolution paths:**
   - Negotiated settlement
   - Field investigation (small projects)
   - Formal hearing (contested applications)

### Permit Terms and Conditions

Permits specify:
- Amounts authorized
- Construction timetables
- Season of diversion
- Fish and wildlife protection measures
- Monitoring and reporting requirements

Standard terms are organized by category:
- Basic administration (Terms 5-19)
- Supplemental requirements (20-39)
- Reservoir operation (40-59)
- Fish and wildlife protection (60-79)
- Special watershed protections (80-99)
- Water quality (100-109)
- Environmental mitigation (200-300)

### License Conversion

After project completion and beneficial use established:
1. Notify State Water Board project is ready for licensing
2. Division conducts field inspection
3. Verifies compliance with all permit conditions
4. License issued only for amount actually put to beneficial use
5. Recorded in County Recorder's Office

**Timeline:** Entire process typically takes 5-7 years from application to permit, with additional years before licensing.

## Related Programs

### Water Transfers and Changes

**Petition for Change (Water Code §1700 et seq.):**
- Required for changes to place of use, purpose, point of diversion
- Subject to "no injury rule"—cannot harm other legal users
- Cannot change source, total quantity, season, or priority date

### Temporary and Urgency Permits

**Temporary permits for groundwater recharge:**
- 180-day or 5-year options
- Faster processing than standard permits
- Junior to all existing rights

**Temporary urgency change petitions:**
- Up to 180 days
- For emergency conditions (drought, supply disruption)

### Water Rights Registration Program

Streamlined process for small projects:
- **Small Domestic Use:** Up to 600 AF/year for household purposes
- **Small Irrigation Use:** Agricultural irrigation with acreage limits
- **Livestock Stockpond:** Watering livestock

### Groundwater and SGMA

**Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (2014):**
- Requires local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs)
- Must develop Groundwater Sustainability Plans
- Achieve sustainability within 20 years

**Overlying groundwater rights:** Similar to riparian—landowners have correlative rights to pump from underlying basin.

**Adjudicated basins:** Court-determined allocation of rights in overdrafted basins.

## Measurement and Reporting

**Required for diversions >10 AF/year:**
- Measure diversions per Board-specified methods
- File annual reports (October 1 - September 30 water year)
- Post-1914 permittees: Progress reports
- Riparian/pre-1914: Statements of Water Diversion and Use (SWDU)

**Penalties for non-compliance:** Significant civil penalties for failure to report.
