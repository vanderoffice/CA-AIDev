## Content Summary

### standards-overview.md
- Three components framework: beneficial uses, water quality objectives, antidegradation policy
- State Water Board and 9 Regional Water Board structure with table
- Federal integration (CWA Section 303(c), CTR, SIP)
- Triennial review process
- Implementation mechanisms (WDRs, NPDES, 401 certs, TMDLs)
- 20+ beneficial use categories including 2017 tribal additions

### numeric-objectives.md
- pH standards (6.5-8.5 range, 0.2-0.5 unit change limits)
- Dissolved oxygen by beneficial use (5.0-9.0 mg/L thresholds)
- Temperature limits (5°F max increase from natural)
- Bacteria: E. coli (GM 100, STV 320 CFU/100mL), Enterococci (GM 30, STV 110 CFU/100mL)
- Mercury tissue-based standards and 2017 provisions
- Ammonia two-form toxicity and freshwater/saltwater limits
- Metals with hardness-dependent calculations
- California Toxics Rule (CTR) parameters and criteria types
- 2020/2021 Aquatic Toxicity Provisions

### narrative-objectives.md
- Core toxicity narrative ("free from toxic substances")
- "Free from" objectives (floating materials, taste/odor, oil/grease, color, turbidity)
- Biostimulatory substances (nutrients) narrative approach
- Temperature "shall not be altered" provisions
- Sediment quality objectives
- Translation from narrative to numeric through permits and TMDLs
- Compliance assessment methods

## Research Validation

Perplexity research validated:
- California Toxics Rule (40 CFR 131.38) promulgated 2000
- State Implementation Policy effective October 23, 2006
- Resolution 68-16 antidegradation policy from October 24, 1968
- 2017 tribal beneficial uses (CUL, T-SUB, SUB) via Resolution 2017-0027
- 2019 ISWEBE Bacteria Provisions with specific GM and STV values
- 2020/2021 Aquatic Toxicity Provisions superseding prior Basin Plan provisions
