## Content Summary

### 303d-overview.md
- Definition and legal basis (CWA 303(d), 40 CFR 130.7)
- California Integrated Report combining 303(d) + 305(b)
- Biennial cycle with on-cycle/off-cycle rotation
- 2024 statistics: 5,742 total listings, 636 new, 101 delisted
- Regional breakdown showing Los Angeles with +297 listings
- EPA approval process and December 2024 partial disapproval

### listing-process.md
- Five-category assessment system:
  - Categories 1-2: Uses supported
  - Category 3: Watch list (insufficient data)
  - Category 4a/4b/4c: Impaired but TMDL not required
  - Category 5: THE 303(d) LIST (TMDL required)
- California Listing Policy with 11 listing factors
- Binomial distribution methodology (3%/18% thresholds)
- Delisting requirements (higher data standards)
- 2024 EPA controversy over benthic community effects

### common-impairments.md
- Pathogens/bacteria (urban, coastal)
- Mercury (legacy mining, bioaccumulation)
- Pesticides (pyrethroids, organophosphates)
- Nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus → eutrophication)
- Metals (copper, zinc, selenium, lead)
- Sediment/siltation (erosion, construction)
- Trash (urban stormwater)
- Dissolved oxygen (low DO from organic enrichment)
- Temperature (cold water habitat impairment)
- PCBs (legacy industrial)
- Regional patterns across California's 9 regions

## Research Validation

Perplexity research confirmed:
- 2024 Integrated Report: 5,742 waterbody-pollutant combinations
- 636 new listings, 101 delistings
- EPA partial approval/partial disapproval December 13, 2024
- 53 disputed listings (44 benthic, 9 Category 4b disputes)
- Binomial methodology with 3%/18% thresholds
- Regional breakdown by water board
- On-cycle 2024: SF Bay, LA, Santa Ana

## Quality Notes

- Markdown headers format (no YAML frontmatter)
- Specific 2024 Integrated Report statistics included
- EPA controversy documented
- Connected to related topics (TMDLs, standards)
- Suitable for RAG retrieval with clear section structure
