## Objective
Create comprehensive knowledge files covering California's beneficial use designations under Porter-Cologne, the full catalog of use categories, and how beneficial uses connect to water quality standards.

## Deliverables

├── beneficial-uses-overview.md
├── use-categories.md
└── designation-process.md
```

## Research Sources (Validated via Perplexity)
- Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (1969)
- Basin Plan beneficial use tables
- State Water Board beneficial use definitions
- Tribal Beneficial Uses (TBUs) - 2017 addition

- Use Attainability Analysis (UAA) - 6 factors for changing uses
- Regional Board authority to designate
- Triennial review cycle
- Tribal beneficial use designation process (tribe-initiated)
- Tributary rule (upstream must support downstream uses)

## Execution Steps
1. Create beneficial-uses/ subdirectory
2. Write beneficial-uses-overview.md
3. Write use-categories.md with all 25+ designations
4. Write designation-process.md
5. Multi-model validate
6. Create SUMMARY-06-02.md

## Quality Standard
- Multi-model validation pattern
- Markdown headers format
- Include all beneficial use acronyms and definitions
