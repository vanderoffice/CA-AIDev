<objective>
Populate the URL registry with 2-5 verified URLs for all remaining topics — Programs (~84), Funding (~22), Consumer FAQ (~12), Public Resources (~21), Small Systems (~10), Community Resources (~8), and Water Supply (~5). These are the educational, consumer-facing, and program-specific topics.

Purpose: Complete the topic coverage so every WaterBot topic has actionable links before Phase 2 content rewriting begins.
Output: `url_registry.json` updated with URLs for remaining ~162 topic entries.

**Registry with core topics already populated:**
@rag-content/waterbot/url_registry.json

**Source content for topic context:**
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_programs.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_conservation.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_public_resources.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_consumer_faq.json

@rag-content/waterbot/batch_gap_filler.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_additional_topics.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_final_topics.json

**Research approach:**
Use site_map from 01-01 as guide. Many Programs topics cluster around a few SWRCB program sections. Consumer FAQ topics need EPA consumer pages + DDW resources. Small Systems topics map to DDW small water systems section. Work by subcategory cluster.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Populate URLs for Programs, Funding, and Water Supply topics</name>
  <files>rag-content/waterbot/url_registry.json</files>
  <action>
  Research and populate 2-5 URLs for Programs (~84 topics), Funding (~22 topics), and Water Supply (~5 topics).

  **Programs** is the largest category (~84 topics) with these subcategories:
  - Conservation (8): Graywater, Rainwater, Save Our Water, Landscape Irrigation, 20x2020, AB 1668/SB 606, SB 1157, Water Use Efficiency
  - Stormwater (3): Urban Runoff, BMPs, Capture/Reuse
  - Environmental (3): Instream Flow, Fish Passage, Invasive Species
  - Wastewater (2): Biosolids, Septic/OWTS
  - Recycled Water (2): Regulations, Agricultural Reuse
  - Cleanup (2): UST Program, Site Cleanup
  - Plus 20+ individual topics across Technology, Infrastructure, Climate, Treatment, Dam Safety, etc.

  **Efficiency approach for Programs:**
  - Conservation topics → waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation/ + saveourwater.com
  - Stormwater topics → waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/
  - Environmental → waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ (various)
  - Cleanup → waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cleanup/
  - Recycled water → waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/recycledwater/
  - Each subcategory shares a parent URL — derive topic-specific pages from section navigation

  **Funding** (~22 topics):
  - SAFER (3): Overview, Eligibility, Funding Amounts → waterboards.ca.gov/safer/
  - SRF (2): Clean Water SRF, Drinking Water SRF → waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/grants_loans/srf/
  - DAC Grants → waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/grants_loans/
  - Small Community, Rural Systems, Water Quality, Stormwater funding
  - Many already have URLs from existing files — verify and supplement

  **Water Supply** (~5 topics):
  - Desalination, Groundwater Banking, ASR, CA Water Infrastructure, Interconnections
  - water.ca.gov and waterboards.ca.gov/groundwater/ are primary sources

  For each URL added, set all fields: label, url, type, agency, stable.
  Update stats after completion.

  <name>Task 2: Populate URLs for Consumer FAQ, Public Resources, Small Systems, and Community Resources topics</name>
  <files>rag-content/waterbot/url_registry.json</files>
  <action>
  Research and populate 2-5 URLs for Consumer FAQ (~12 topics), Public Resources (~21 topics), Small Systems (~10 topics), and Community Resources/Advocacy (~8 topics).

  **Consumer FAQ** (~12 topics):
  - Water quality concerns (hard water, chlorine, cloudy water, taste/odor) → EPA consumer pages, DDW drinking water FAQ
  - CCR/violation notices → EPA CCR finder, DDW annual reports
  - Treatment (boiling, bottled vs tap) → EPA home water treatment
  - Private wells, vulnerable populations, disasters → EPA/DDW specific pages
  - Conservation and billing → SWRCB conservation, CPUC billing

  **Public Resources** (~21 topics):
  - Contacts (3 topics) — already have URLs, verify + supplement
  - Consumer-facing: billing, complaints, testing, conservation → CPUC, DDW, local health dept references
  - Data/reports: CCR, public records, monitoring → DDW data portals, CIWQS, GeoTracker
  - EJ resources → waterboards.ca.gov/environmental_justice/

  **Small Systems** (~10 topics):
  - DDW small water systems section: waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/smallwatersystems/
  - Operator guides (5): TMF self-assessment, consolidation, funding navigator, emergency response, compliance basics
  - System types: state small, transient, NTNCWS
  - Rate setting, mutual companies, technical assistance

  **Community Resources / Advocate Toolkit** (~8 topics):
  - CIWQS database → ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov
  - GeoTracker → geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov
  - Clean Water Team → waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/cwt/
  - Board meetings → waterboards.ca.gov/board_info/calendar/
  - EJ complaints → waterboards.ca.gov/environmental_justice/
  - Public records, needs assessment, advocacy contacts
