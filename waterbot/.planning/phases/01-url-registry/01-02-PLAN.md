<objective>
Populate the URL registry with 2-5 verified, actionable CA gov URLs for every core topic — Water Quality (~40 topics), Permits (~40 topics), Compliance (~28 topics), and Regional Boards (~10 topics).

Purpose: These are the highest-impact categories — regulatory, compliance, and contaminant topics where users most need actionable links to portals, forms, and official guidance.
Output: `url_registry.json` updated with URLs for ~118 core topic entries.

**Registry with schema and site map:**
@rag-content/waterbot/url_registry.json

**Source content for topic context:**
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_pollutants.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_permits_compliance.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_regional_boards.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_consumer_faq.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_gap_filler.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_additional_topics.json
@rag-content/waterbot/batch_final_topics.json

**Constraining decisions:**
- Prefer stable parent/landing pages over deep links (CA gov restructures frequently)
- 2-5 URLs per topic — not more. Quality over quantity.
- URL types: info, portal, form, database, contact, regulation, tool
- Agencies: SWRCB, DDW, EPA, DWR, OEHHA, Regional Board
- Inline URLs in content (not just metadata) — embeddings will include URL text

**Research approach:**
Use the site_map from 01-01 as the primary research guide. For each topic cluster:
1. Navigate the mapped domain section
2. Find the specific page for each topic
3. Add 2-5 URLs prioritizing: (a) the official program/topic page, (b) application/forms portal, (c) relevant regulation text, (d) data/monitoring tool, (e) contact information

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Populate URLs for Water Quality and Permits topics</name>
  <files>rag-content/waterbot/url_registry.json</files>
  <action>
  Research and populate 2-5 URLs for each topic in the Water Quality (~40 topics) and Permits (~40 topics) categories.

  **Water Quality topics** (~40) include:
  - Contaminants: PFAS, Lead, Arsenic, Nitrate, Chromium-6, DBPs, TCP, Uranium, Perchlorate, Bacteria, Copper, Mercury, Nutrients (13 topics)
  - Standards: Water Quality Standards, Secondary Standards, Sediment Quality (3 topics)
  - Plus: HABs, Fluoride, Source Protection, Salinity, Pharmaceuticals, Microplastics, Waterborne Disease, Temperature TMDLs, Groundwater Quality, Bioassessment, Impaired Waters 303(d), etc.

  For contaminant topics, prioritize:
  - DDW contaminant fact sheet page (waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/[contaminant])
  - EPA contaminant page (epa.gov/sdwa or ground-water-and-drinking-water)
  - OEHHA Public Health Goal page (oehha.ca.gov/water)
  - Any relevant monitoring database or data portal

  **Permits topics** (~40) include:
  - Fee schedules: 401 Cert Fees, NPDES Fees, Stormwater Fees (3 topics)
  - Permit types: CGP, IGP, MS4, NPDES Application, 401 Cert, WDRs, Dewatering (7+ topics)
  - Specialized: Industrial, Cannabis, Marine/Ballast/Dredging, Well Permits (8+ topics)

  For permit topics, prioritize:
  - SWRCB permit program landing page
  - Application/forms page
  - Fee schedule page (if applicable)
  - Relevant general order or regulation page

  Use WebSearch to find current URLs. Use the site_map from Plan 01-01 as a starting guide. Work by subcategory cluster for efficiency — research a group of related topics together rather than individually.

  For each URL added, set all fields: label, url, type, agency, stable. Mark parent/landing pages as stable=true, deep links as stable=false.

  Update the stats section after all entries are populated.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Populate URLs for Compliance and Regional Boards topics</name>
  <files>rag-content/waterbot/url_registry.json</files>
  <action>
  Research and populate 2-5 URLs for each topic in Compliance (~28 topics) and Regional Boards (~10 topics).

  **Compliance topics** (~28) include:
  - Monitoring: Equipment, NPDES M&R, Testing Schedule (3 topics)
  - Reporting: Annual Reporting Requirements
  - Enforcement: Water Quality Enforcement
  - Operator Certification, Sanitary Surveys, Cross-Connection Control
  - Water Loss Management, Emergency Response, Lead Service Lines
  - SGMA Implementation, Cybersecurity, Asset Management
  - Conservation: Urban Water Use Objectives

  For compliance topics, prioritize:
  - SWRCB/DDW compliance program page
  - Relevant regulation or general order
  - Reporting portal or submission form
  - Guidance document or template

  **Regional Boards** (~10 topics):
  - 9 individual regional boards (Regions 1-9)
  - State vs Regional Board Responsibilities

  For each regional board, add:
  - Main board website (waterboards.ca.gov/[region]/)
  - Board meeting/agenda page
  - Programs/permits page
  - Complaints/reporting page
  - Contact page

  The 9 regional board URLs follow a predictable pattern from the site_map. Map all 9 efficiently:
  - Region 1: northcoast
  - Region 2: sanfranciscobay
  - Region 3: centralcoast
  - Region 4: losangeles
  - Region 5: centralvalley
  - Region 6: lahontan
  - Region 7: coloradoriver
  - Region 8: santaana
  - Region 9: sandiego

  Update stats after all entries populated.
