- Department of Water Resources
- State Water Resources Control Board

## Key Topics Covered

### Adaptation Strategies Overview
- California Climate Adaptation Strategy framework
- Nature-based solutions (floodplain restoration, wetlands, urban greening)
- Water Resilience Portfolio (Executive Order N-10-19)
- Climate bond funding (Proposition 4: $10 billion)
- Regulatory integration of climate considerations
- Regional and local implementation mechanisms

### Water Supply Diversification
- Recycled water (728,000 AF current, 800,000 AF new target by 2030)
- Seawater and brackish desalination
- Stormwater capture (potential 580,000-1.4 million AF)
- Groundwater banking and conjunctive use
- Surface storage enhancement (Sites Reservoir, Temperance Flat)
- Water transfers and markets

### Infrastructure Resilience
- Aging infrastructure challenges
- Delta conveyance and resilience (single tunnel project)
- Flood management infrastructure adaptation
- Wildfire impacts on water systems
- Coastal infrastructure and sea level rise
- Dam safety modernization (Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations)
- Funding mechanisms (Proposition 4, State Revolving Fund, WIFIA)

## Validation Method
- Perplexity research with California-specific regulatory focus
- Cross-referenced with state agency programs and recent legislation
