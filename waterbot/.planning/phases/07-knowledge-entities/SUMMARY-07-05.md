## Key Content Covered

### epa-delegation.md

**NPDES Delegation:**
- California delegated since 1973 (among first states)
- Full authority for permits, enforcement, modifications
- Data flows: CIWQS → ICIS-NPDES

**Water Quality Standards:**
- EPA reviews within 90 days of submission
- California human health criteria (2017) more stringent
- Triennial review requirement

**TMDL Oversight:**

- Section 106: Pollution control programs
- Section 319: 40% non-federal match for NPS

**NEPA/CEQA Interface:**
- Joint documents for federal funding/permits
