## Key Findings

### EPA Programs

| Program | Federal Share | Key Feature |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| WIFIA | Up to 49% (loan) | $20M min, 35-year terms |
| BIL SRF | Varies | CA: ~$468M FY2025 |
| Section 319 | 75% | NPS grants, $3-4M/year CA |
| Brownfields | Up to 100% | Water remediation components |

**Critical:** BIL mandates most funding to disadvantaged communities (DACs) through grants/principal forgiveness.

### USDA Rural Development

| Program | Max Funding | Population Limit |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Water & Waste Loan/Grant | No cap | 10,000 |
| Emergency (ECWAG) | $1,000,000 | 10,000 |
| SEARCH | $60,000 | 2,500 |
| Circuit Rider TA | Free services | 10,000 |

**Q1 2026 Interest Rates:**
- Poverty-level: 2.875%
- Intermediate: 3.750%
- Market: 4.750%

### FEMA Hazard Mitigation

| Program | Status | Federal Share |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| HMGP | Active (post-disaster) | 75-90% |
| BRIC | **TERMINATED** (litigation pending) | 75-90% |
| FMA | Active (annual competitive) | 75-100% |
| PDM | Congressional earmarks only | Varies |

**Critical Alert:** BRIC terminated April 2025; ~$870M California projects at risk. Federal court blocked fund reallocation August 2025 but did not restore program.

**BCA Discount Rate:** Reverted to 7% (April 2025), making cost-effectiveness harder to demonstrate.

### Other Federal Sources

| Program | Agency | Federal Share |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| WaterSMART | Reclamation | 50% |
| Title XVI | Reclamation | 25% (max $20M) |
| Section 219 | USACE | 75-90% |
| CDBG | HUD | Formula-based |
| EDA Public Works | Commerce | Varies |

**WaterSMART Impact:** $3.86B since 2010, leveraging $9.2B non-federal.

## Notable Research Insights

1. **Funding Gap:** Title XVI demand exceeds available funding by >$700 million

2. **BRIC Crisis:** California had $870M in BRIC projects—now uncertain pending litigation

3. **DAC Priority:** Multiple programs mandate benefits flow to disadvantaged communities (Justice40 Initiative)

4. **Cost-Share Stacking:** Projects can combine federal sources (e.g., Reclamation planning + USACE construction + state match)

5. **Environmental Compliance:** All federal programs require NEPA; some fund compliance costs
