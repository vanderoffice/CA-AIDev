# SUMMARY-10-02: CIWQS and eWRIMS Systems

## Status: COMPLETE

## Deliverables Created

1. **ciwqs-overview.md** - CIWQS purpose, permit tracking, eSMR reports, violation tracking, MMP rules, enforcement statistics, public reports
2. **ewrims-overview.md** - eWRIMS legacy system, CalWATRS transition (June 2025), statements of diversion, water right types, reporting requirements
3. **regulatory-data-integration.md** - System relationships, cross-referencing workflows, due diligence procedures, complaint process

## Key Facts Captured

- CIWQS launched July 2005 for water quality permit/compliance tracking
- eSMR data available 2006-present via California Open Data Portal
- FY 2024-25: ~$29.1M in penalties assessed
- eWRIMS decommissioned June 9, 2025
- CalWATRS launched July 2025 with new account system
- Water rights complaints: ~50/year typical, 200+/year during drought
- Statements of diversion ≠ confirmed water rights (self-reported)

## Research Validation

- Perplexity confirmed CalWATRS transition timeline
- Verified current enforcement statistics
- Confirmed MMP thresholds (4 violations/180 days, 20-40% exceedance)
- Cross-referenced public report availability
