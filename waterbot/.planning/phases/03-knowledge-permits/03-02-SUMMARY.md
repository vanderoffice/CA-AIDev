## Research Method

Used Perplexity Deep Research for both topics:
1. **Individual NPDES permits** - Comprehensive query covering ROWD, effluent limits, public notice, sector-specific requirements, 40 CFR 122, recent enforcement
2. **MS4 permits** - Comprehensive query covering Phase I/II distinction, six MCMs, TMDL integration, regional permits, enforcement history, upcoming changes

Both research queries returned 50+ citations each, synthesized into structured markdown.

## Content Highlights

### Individual NPDES Permits
- **When required:** Unique discharge characteristics, sensitive waters, complex treatment, not eligible for general permit
- **Application:** Form 200 (state) + EPA forms (1, 2A-2F by facility type) + technical report signed by registered civil engineer
- **Effluent limitations:** TBELs (Secondary Treatment for POTWs: BOD₅ ≤30 mg/L, TSS ≤30 mg/L, ≥85% removal) + WQBELs where needed for water quality
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months typical; must apply 180 days before new discharge or permit expiration
- **Public process:** 30-day comment period, newspaper notice, Regional Board hearing, 30-day EPA review
- **Sector requirements:**
  - POTWs: Pretreatment programs for >5 MGD with industrial inputs
  - Industrial: BAT/BCT standards, industry-specific guidelines
  - Power plants: Once-Through Cooling Policy, 316(b) intake requirements

### MS4 Permits
- **Phase I:** ≥100,000 population, regional permits in CA, comprehensive SWMP
- **Phase II:** Urbanized areas ≥50,000 (updated 2023), statewide general permit, Six MCMs
- **Six Minimum Control Measures:**
  1. Public education and outreach
  2. Public participation and involvement
  3. Illicit discharge detection and elimination (IDDE)
  4. Construction site runoff control (≥1 acre)
  5. Post-construction runoff control (LID emphasis)
  6. Pollution prevention/good housekeeping
- **TMDL integration:** Wasteload allocations become WQBELs; Time Schedule Orders for extended compliance
- **Key CA permits:** LA County (99 permittees), San Diego (39 permittees), SF Bay MRP (multi-county)
- **Critical deadline:** December 2, 2030 - 100% trash control per Trash Amendments
- **Upcoming:** Phase II permit reissuance expected late 2026

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Both files exist in `knowledge/03-permits/npdes/`
- [x] Individual permit process clearly explained (application → adoption → EPA review)
- [x] MS4 covers both Phase I and Phase II distinctions
- [x] Six Minimum Control Measures documented
- [x] TMDL requirements explained
- [x] Regional CA permits (LA, San Diego, SF Bay) covered
- [x] All claims cite official sources (EPA, Water Boards, CFR)
- [x] Format matches existing knowledge base style (headers, tables, no YAML frontmatter)

## Gaps Identified for Later Phases

1. **WDR permits** - Land discharge requirements (planned 03-03-PLAN)
2. **401 Certification** - CWA Section 401 process (planned 03-04-PLAN)
3. **Water rights** - Appropriative/riparian rights (planned 03-05-PLAN)
4. **Specific LID design guidance** - Could expand with design manual references
5. **Caltrans MS4 permit** - Statewide transportation permit (Order WQ 2022-0060-DWQ)

## Notes

- MS4 permit landscape is evolving: Phase II reissuance in 2026, trash deadline 2030
- Supreme Court ruling (San Francisco v. EPA, March 2025) clarified that permits cannot impose "end-result" conditions based on receiving water quality—must specify permittee actions
- San Francisco CSO enforcement (2025) demonstrates consequences of operational non-compliance even with permit coverage
- LA County permit is one of the most comprehensive/stringent in the nation
