# 03-03 Summary: WDR Permits

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: WDR Framework and Requirements
**File:** `knowledge/03-permits/wdr/wdr-overview.md`

Documented:
- WDR vs NPDES distinction (land/groundwater vs surface water)
- Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act authority and principles
- Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD) Form 200 application process
- Regional Board jurisdiction (9 boards by hydrological boundaries)
- General vs Individual WDR distinction
- Monitoring and reporting requirements (CIWQS submission)
- Common WDR categories (wastewater, landfills, mining, agriculture, septic)
- Fee schedules (FY 2025-26 examples)
- Enforcement mechanisms (NOV, Cease & Desist, ACL, criminal referral)

### Task 2: WDR General Orders and Regional Variations
**File:** `knowledge/03-permits/wdr/wdr-general-orders.md`

Documented:

**Statewide General Orders:**
- Winery Order (WQ 2021-0002-DWQ) - 4-tier structure by volume
- Dairy General Orders (regional, e.g., R5-2007-0035, R1-2019-0001)
- Timber Harvest General Orders (exempt activities, THP requirements)
- Low-Threat Discharge Orders (tiers 1A through 3)
- Cannabis Cultivation (WQ 2023-0102-DWQ) - tier + risk structure
- Small Domestic Wastewater (WQ 2014-0153-DWQ) - OWTS integration

**Regional Variations:**
- Central Valley (Region 5): ILRP, Salt and Nitrate Control, coalitions
- Lahontan (Region 6): Lake Tahoe zero discharge, alpine sensitivity
- San Francisco Bay (Region 2): Estuary management, legacy contamination
- North Coast (Region 1): Salmonid protection, timber/cannabis focus
- Los Angeles (Region 4): Urban density, strict stormwater

**Eligibility Guidance:**
- Decision tree for General Order vs Individual WDR
- Volume thresholds by program
- Location-based restrictions
- Disqualifying factors

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Files exist in `03-permits/wdr/`
- [x] WDR vs NPDES clearly distinguished (land/groundwater vs surface water)
- [x] General orders covered with eligibility criteria and tier structures
- [x] Regional variations noted (all 9 regions, key differences highlighted)

## Files Created

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| wdr-overview.md | `knowledge/03-permits/wdr/` | WDR framework, process, enforcement |
| wdr-general-orders.md | `knowledge/03-permits/wdr/` | Statewide orders, regional variations |

## Key Insights for WaterBot

1. **WDR is California-only** - fills federal regulatory gap for land/groundwater discharges
2. **General Orders save time** - 30-60 days vs 6-12 months for individual permits
3. **Region matters** - same discharge type can have different requirements by location
4. **Coalitions reduce burden** - especially valuable for agricultural operations
5. **Volume thresholds are key** - determine tier and requirements
