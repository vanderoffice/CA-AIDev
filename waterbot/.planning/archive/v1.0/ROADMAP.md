# Roadmap: WaterBot Next-Level Overhaul

## Overview

Transform WaterBot from a factually accurate but link-poor knowledge base into one where every response is both accurate AND actionable. The journey: build a master URL registry, rewrite all content with inline links and "Take Action" sections, rebuild the database, update the n8n system prompt to surface links, then validate everything against the existing adversarial baseline.
