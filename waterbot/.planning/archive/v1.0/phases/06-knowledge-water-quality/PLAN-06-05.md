# PLAN-06-05: 303(d) Impaired Waters List

## Objective
Create comprehensive knowledge files covering California's 303(d) list of impaired water bodies - the regulatory mechanism for identifying waters not meeting water quality standards.

## Deliverables
```
knowledge/06-water-quality/impaired-waters/
├── 303d-overview.md
├── listing-process.md
└── common-impairments.md
```

## Research Sources (Validated via Perplexity)
- Clean Water Act Section 303(d)
- California Section 303(d) Listing Policy
- California Integrated Report (2024)
- EPA partial approval/disapproval letters
- Regional Water Board 303(d) lists

## Content Outline

### 303d-overview.md
- Definition: inventory of water bodies not meeting water quality standards
- Legal basis: CWA Section 303(d), 40 CFR 130.7
- California Integrated Report (combines 303(d) + 305(b) assessment)
- Biennial cycle: submitted to EPA April 1 of even years
- On-cycle vs off-cycle regions (3 regions per cycle, 6-year full rotation)
- State Water Board administers public process (since 2020-2022 cycle)
- 2024 Integrated Report: 636 new listings, 101 delistings

### listing-process.md
- **5-Category System:**
  - Category 1: All uses supported, none threatened
  - Category 2: All uses supported, some threatened
  - Category 3: Insufficient data (requires further assessment)
  - Category 4a: Impaired but TMDL exists
  - Category 4b: Impaired but alternative program addresses it
  - Category 4c: Impaired by non-pollutant (e.g., flow alteration)
  - **Category 5: THE 303(d) LIST** - TMDL required

- **Listing factors:**
  - Numeric water quality objectives exceedances
  - Narrative objectives violations
  - Toxicity in water/sediment
  - Adverse biological response
  - Nuisance conditions

- **California Listing Policy:** Statistical analysis using binomial distribution
- **Delisting requirements:** Demonstrate standards attained, maintain going forward
- **EPA review:** 30 days to approve/disapprove, can add listings

### common-impairments.md
2024 California data (new listings):
- **Pesticides**: 222 listings (ag regions, urban areas)
- **Metals**: 147 listings (mercury, lead, copper, zinc)
- **Pathogens/Bacteria**: 79 listings
  - E. coli in freshwater
  - Enterococci in marine
  - Sources: sewage, animal waste, septic failures
- **Nutrients**: Nitrogen, phosphorus → eutrophication
- **Temperature**: Cold water habitat impairment
- **Dissolved Oxygen**: Low DO from organic decomposition
- **Sediment/Turbidity**: Erosion, construction, mining
- **Salinity/TDS**: Arid region impacts

Recent EPA controversy (2024):
- 44 waterbodies with benthic community degradation
- State placed in Category 3, EPA wanted Category 5
- 9 additional Category 4b disputes

## Execution Steps
1. Create impaired-waters/ subdirectory
2. Write 303d-overview.md
3. Write listing-process.md with category details
4. Write common-impairments.md with California data
5. Multi-model validate
6. Create SUMMARY-06-05.md

## Quality Standard
- Multi-model validation pattern
- Markdown headers format
- Include specific 2024 Integrated Report statistics
