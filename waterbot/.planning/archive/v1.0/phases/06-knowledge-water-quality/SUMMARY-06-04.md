## Content Summary

### tmdl-overview.md
- TMDL definition and purpose
- The TMDL equation: TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS
  - Wasteload Allocations (point sources)
  - Load Allocations (nonpoint sources)
  - Margin of Safety (uncertainty)
- Legal foundation (CWA 303(d), 40 CFR 130.7)
- California's Basin Plan integration approach
- Phased implementation and adaptive management

### tmdl-development.md
- California's three-phase process:
  1. Project Plan (scope, schedule, approach)
  2. TMDL Project Report + Implementation Plan
  3. Basin Plan Amendment
- Required elements: problem statement, numeric targets, source analysis, linkage analysis, allocations
- CEQA compliance through substitute environmental document
- Approval chain: Regional Board → State Board → OAL → EPA
- Typical 4-6 year development timeline

### tmdl-implementation.md
- Point source implementation via NPDES permits
- Nonpoint source implementation via voluntary and regulatory mix
- CWA Section 319 funding for nonpoint source controls
- Major California TMDL examples with numeric targets:
  - **LA River Trash TMDL**: Zero trash target, full capture systems
  - **SF Bay Mercury TMDL**: 0.2 mg/kg fish tissue, 700 kg/year total load
  - **Delta Methylmercury TMDL**: Methylation control focus
  - **Guadalupe River Mercury TMDL**: Legacy mining, 20+ year timeline
- Monitoring requirements and adaptive management triggers

## Research Validation

Perplexity research confirmed:
- TMDL equation components and definitions
- California's specific development process
- Regulatory approval chain accuracy
- Numeric targets from actual TMDLs:
  - SF Bay Mercury: 11 kg/yr municipal wastewater, 80 kg/yr urban runoff
  - LA River Trash: Zero trash visible in water column
  - Delta Methylmercury: Focus on methylation conditions
- Caltrans subject to 60+ TMDLs statewide
- Implementation timelines often extend beyond original projections

## Quality Notes

- Markdown headers format (no YAML frontmatter)
- Specific numeric targets from real California TMDLs
- Connected to related topics (permits, monitoring, standards)
- Suitable for RAG retrieval with clear section structure
