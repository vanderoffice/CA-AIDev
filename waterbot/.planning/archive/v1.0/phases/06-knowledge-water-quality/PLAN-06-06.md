# PLAN-06-06: Water Quality Monitoring Programs

## Objective
Create comprehensive knowledge files covering California's water quality monitoring infrastructure - SWAMP, CEDEN, permit-based monitoring, and citizen science programs.

## Deliverables
```

## Research Sources (Validated via Perplexity)
- Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP)
- California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN)
- NPDES permit monitoring requirements
- Clean Water Team (citizen monitoring)
- Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment (GAMA)
- Stream Pollution Trends (SPoT) program

## Content Outline

### monitoring-overview.md
- Purpose: assess water quality, detect trends, support regulatory decisions
- Two main types:
  - **Ambient monitoring**: characterize overall water body condition
  - **Compliance monitoring**: verify permit requirements met
- Key monitoring objectives:
  - Evaluate beneficial use attainment
  - Establish baseline/trends
  - Locate pollution sources
  - Evaluate treatment effectiveness
  - Support 303(d) listing decisions
- Data integration through CEDEN

### swamp-ceden.md
**SWAMP (Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program)**
- Established 2001
- Statewide ambient water quality assessment
- Physical, chemical, biological parameters
- Four responsibilities:
  1. Monitor, assess, report on water quality
  2. Establish data quality standards
  3. Identify monitoring needs for policy
  4. Provide data for regulatory requirements
- Regional programs (Sacramento Watershed Coordinated Monitoring)

**CEDEN (California Environmental Data Exchange Network)**
- Central data repository for water quality data
- Aggregates from multiple monitoring programs
- Standardized formats + quality assurance
- Public access to water quality information

**Specialized Programs:**
- **SPoT (Stream Pollution Trends)**: sediment toxicity + contamination trends
- **Bioassessment**: CSCI scoring, benthic macroinvertebrates, algae
- **GAMA**: Groundwater quality monitoring
- **DWR State Water Project monitoring**: 40+ locations since 1968

### compliance-citizen-monitoring.md
**Permit-Based Compliance Monitoring**
- NPDES permits require self-monitoring
- Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) - monthly/quarterly
- Technology-based vs water quality-based limits
- Reasonable Potential Analysis (RPA)
- MS4 stormwater monitoring:
  - Receiving water monitoring
  - Outfall monitoring
  - Toxicity testing

**Citizen Science Programs**
- Clean Water Team (CWT) - statewide support
- Provides: training, QA/QC support, equipment loans
- Over 20 years of volunteer data collection
- Types of participants:
  - Nonprofits
  - Resource Conservation Districts
  - Schools/youth groups
  - Community organizations
- Data quality: QAPPs (Quality Assurance Project Plans)
- Integration into state assessments

**Data Use in Regulatory Decisions**
- 303(d) listing decisions
- TMDL development
- Trend analysis
- Permit limit derivation

## Execution Steps
1. Create monitoring/ subdirectory
2. Write monitoring-overview.md
3. Write swamp-ceden.md with program details
4. Write compliance-citizen-monitoring.md
5. Multi-model validate
6. Create SUMMARY-06-06.md

## Quality Standard
- Multi-model validation pattern
- Markdown headers format
- Include specific program names and data sources
