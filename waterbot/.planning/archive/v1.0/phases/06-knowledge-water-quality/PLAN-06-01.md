# PLAN-06-01: Water Quality Standards & Objectives

## Objective
Create comprehensive knowledge files covering California's water quality standards framework, including numeric vs narrative objectives, key parameters (pH, DO, temperature, bacteria, nutrients, metals), and federal-state interaction.

## Deliverables
```
knowledge/06-water-quality/standards/
├── standards-overview.md
├── numeric-objectives.md
└── narrative-objectives.md
```

## Research Sources (Validated via Perplexity)
- Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act framework
- California Toxics Rule (CTR) - EPA-promulgated numeric criteria
- State Implementation Policy (SIP) for toxics
- California Water Quality Goals database (860+ constituents)
- Basin Plan water quality objectives

## Content Outline

### standards-overview.md
- Three components: beneficial uses, water quality objectives, antidegradation
- Federal CWA Section 303 requirements
- State Water Board + 9 Regional Water Boards structure
- California Toxics Rule (2000) - federal criteria for priority pollutants
- Triennial review process

### numeric-objectives.md
- Definition: specific allowable concentrations/levels
- Key parameters:
  - pH: 6.5-8.5 range, regional variations
  - Dissolved Oxygen: 5.0-8.0 mg/L depending on habitat type
  - Temperature: inverse relationship with DO, species-specific
  - Bacteria: E. coli (freshwater) ≤100 CFU/100mL; Enterococci (saline) ≤30 CFU/100mL
  - Nutrients: generally narrative with site-specific numeric targets
  - Metals: hardness-dependent, site-specific objectives possible
- Assessment thresholds vs objectives

### narrative-objectives.md
- Definition: qualitative descriptions of desired conditions
- Examples: "free from" substances causing nuisance, "shall not contain" toxic concentrations
- Biostimulatory substances (nutrients)
- Temperature "shall not be altered" provisions
- Implementation through TMDLs and basin plan amendments
- Translation to numeric limits for permitting

## Execution Steps
1. Create standards/ subdirectory
2. Write standards-overview.md with framework context
3. Write numeric-objectives.md with parameter details
4. Write narrative-objectives.md with qualitative standards
5. Validate multi-model if needed
6. Create SUMMARY-06-01.md

## Quality Standard
- Multi-model validation: Perplexity → Claude → GPT-4o → Gemini → Reconciliation
- Markdown headers (NOT YAML frontmatter)
- Cite specific regulations and thresholds
