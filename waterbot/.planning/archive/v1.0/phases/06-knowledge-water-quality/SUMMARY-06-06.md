## Content Summary

### monitoring-overview.md
- Two main types: ambient vs. compliance monitoring
- Key monitoring objectives (beneficial use assessment, trends, source ID)
- Physical, chemical, and biological parameters
- Data integration through CEDEN and CIWQS
- Monitoring programs overview table
- Data use in regulatory decisions (303(d), TMDLs, permits)

### swamp-ceden.md
- SWAMP established 2000 by AB 982
- Four statewide programs:
  - Bioaccumulation (fish tissue, 2006)
  - Bioassessment (CSCI scoring)
  - FHAB (harmful algal blooms)
  - SPoT (sediment toxicity/contaminants, 2008)
- CSCI scoring thresholds (0.63, 0.79, 0.92)
- CEDEN data standardization and regional data centers
- GAMA groundwater monitoring
- State Water Project monitoring (since 1968)

### compliance-citizen-monitoring.md
- NPDES self-monitoring (DMRs, SMRs)
- Technology-based vs. water quality-based limits
- Reasonable Potential Analysis (RPA)
- MS4 stormwater monitoring (Phase I, Phase II, Caltrans)
- Clean Water Team citizen science:
  - 20+ years of volunteer monitoring
  - Training, QA/QC support, equipment loans
  - Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPPs)
  - Data quality levels for regulatory use
- CIWQS compliance data system

## Research Validation

Perplexity research confirmed:
- SWAMP established 2000 by AB 982
- Four statewide SWAMP programs as described
- CSCI finalized 2013 with scoring thresholds
- Clean Water Team as official citizen science program
- CEDEN regional data centers (Moss Landing, SFEI, Central Valley, SWAMP IQ)
- GAMA groundwater program
- State Water Project monitoring since 1968 at 40+ locations

## Quality Notes

- Markdown headers format (no YAML frontmatter)
- Program-specific details with dates and scope
- CSCI scoring thresholds included
- Connected to related topics
- Suitable for RAG retrieval
