# PLAN-06-04: TMDLs (Total Maximum Daily Loads)

## Objective
Create comprehensive knowledge files covering California's TMDL program - the mechanism for restoring impaired water bodies through quantitative pollution reduction plans.

## Deliverables
```
knowledge/06-water-quality/tmdls/
├── tmdl-overview.md
├── tmdl-development.md
└── tmdl-implementation.md
```

## Research Sources (Validated via Perplexity)
- Clean Water Act Section 303(d)
- 40 CFR 130.7 (federal TMDL regulations)
- California TMDL Guidance (Water Quality Control Policy for Addressing Impaired Waters)
- Regional Water Board TMDL project pages
- Key California TMDLs: Los Angeles River Trash, SF Bay Mercury, Delta Methylmercury

## Content Outline

### tmdl-overview.md
- Definition: maximum pollutant load a water body can receive while meeting standards
- TMDL equation: **TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS**
  - WLA = Wasteload Allocations (point sources)
  - LA = Load Allocations (nonpoint sources)
  - MOS = Margin of Safety
- Triggered by 303(d) listing
- Purpose: bridge between water quality standards and implementation
- California's phased approach (adaptive management)
- One TMDL per waterbody-pollutant combination

### tmdl-development.md
California's 3-step process:
1. **Project Plan**
   - Identifies water body, pollutant, beneficial uses
   - Establishes scope and schedule
   - Outlines analytical approach

2. **TMDL Project Report + Implementation Plan**
   Required elements:
   - Problem statement
   - Numeric targets (desired conditions)
   - Source analysis (who's contributing)
   - Linkage analysis (how targets relate to actions)
   - Load/wasteload allocations
   - Margin of safety (implicit or explicit)
   - Seasonal variation consideration
   - Implementation plan (actions, responsible parties, schedules)
   - Monitoring and re-evaluation strategy

3. **Basin Plan Amendment**
   - Staff report + CEQA substitute environmental document
   - External peer review
   - Regional Board adoption
   - State Board → OAL → EPA approval chain
   - Timeline: 4-6 years typical

### tmdl-implementation.md
- Point source implementation: NPDES permits with WQBELs
- Nonpoint source implementation: voluntary + regulatory mix
  - Cost-sharing programs (EPA 319)
  - Best Management Practices (BMPs)
  - Watershed management plans
- Key California TMDL examples:
  - **LA River Trash TMDL**: Zero trash target, full capture systems
  - **SF Bay Mercury TMDL**: 160 kg/yr from urban runoff → 80 kg/yr target
  - **Delta Methylmercury TMDL**: Bioaccumulation in fish tissue focus
  - **Nutrient TMDLs**: Lake Elsinore, Canyon Lake
  - **Sediment TMDLs**: North Coast implementation policy
- Monitoring for effectiveness
- Adaptive management triggers

## Execution Steps
1. Create tmdls/ subdirectory
2. Write tmdl-overview.md
3. Write tmdl-development.md with process details
4. Write tmdl-implementation.md with California examples
5. Multi-model validate
6. Create SUMMARY-06-04.md

## Quality Standard
- Multi-model validation pattern
- Markdown headers format
- Include specific numeric targets from real TMDLs
