### 401 Triggers

- FERC hydropower licenses
- Coast Guard bridge permits
- Rivers and Harbors Act permits

### California Jurisdiction

- State Water Board - Division of Water Quality: Multi-regional projects

### Critical Procedures
- Pre-filing meeting required 30 days before application

- Denial = federal permit cannot issue

### Recent Developments
- Sackett decision (2023) narrowed federal WOTUS definition
- California maintains broader "waters of the state" jurisdiction
- 2026 proposed EPA rule would narrow state 401 authority
- Sites Reservoir denied 401 (September 2024)
