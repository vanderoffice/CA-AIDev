No federal nexus means no 401 certification requirement - though you may still need state permits under California's Porter-Cologne Act.\n\n### Does Your Project Have Federal Nexus?\n\nAsk these questions:\n\n1. **Will you discharge dredged or fill material into waters?**\n   - If yes → Likely need Section 404 permit from Army Corps → 401 required\n\n2. **Will you build or modify a hydropower facility?**\n   - If yes → Need FERC license → 401 required\n\n3. **Will you construct or modify a bridge over navigable waters?**\n   - If yes → Need Coast Guard permit → 401 required\n\n4. **Will you build structures in navigable waters?**\n   - If yes → Need Rivers and Harbors Act permit → 401 required\n\n5. **Are the affected waters \"Waters of the United States\"?**\n   - If no → No federal nexus, but state permits may apply",

EPA** decision (May 2023) dramatically narrowed federal jurisdiction.\n\n### Current WOTUS Definition\n\nFederal jurisdiction now covers only:\n\n1. **Traditional navigable waters** - Rivers, lakes, oceans used in interstate commerce\n2. **Relatively permanent waters** - Standing or continuously flowing bodies forming geographic features (streams, rivers, lakes)\n3. **Wetlands with continuous surface connection** - Must physically abut jurisdictional waters (touching, not just nearby)\n\n### What's NO Longer Federally Jurisdictional\n\n- Wetlands connected only through groundwater\n- Wetlands separated from jurisdictional waters by berms, roads, or breaks\n- Ephemeral streams (flow only during/after rain)\n- Isolated wetlands without surface connection to navigable waters\n- Waters with only \"significant nexus\" to navigable waters\n\n### March 2025 EPA/Army Corps Clarification\n\n\"Continuous surface connection\" means **abutting (touching)**. A wetland must physically touch a relatively permanent water body to be federally jurisdictional.\n\n### Practical Impact\n\nMany waters that previously required Section 404 permits (and thus 401 certification) are now outside federal jurisdiction. However:\n\n- These waters remain **waters of the state** under California law\n- You may still need **Waste Discharge Requirements** from California\n- California's wetland definition is broader than the federal definition",

Regional Boards develop TMDLs for impaired waters\n2. TMDLs assign **wasteload allocations** to MS4 discharges\n3. MS4 permits incorporate these allocations as **water quality-based effluent limits (WQBELs)**\n4. Permittees must demonstrate compliance or implement approved compliance schedules\n\n### Common TMDL Pollutants for MS4s\n\n| Pollutant | Sources | Controls |\n|-----------|---------|----------|\n| **Bacteria/Pathogens** | Pet waste, homeless encampments, sanitary sewer leaks | IDDE, pet waste programs, SSO reduction |\n| **Trash** | Litter, illegal dumping | Full capture devices, street sweeping, education |\n| **Sediment** | Construction, erosion | Construction controls, stabilization |\n| **Nutrients** | Fertilizers, landscaping | Fertilizer management, LID |\n| **Metals** | Vehicles, industrial | Source control, treatment BMPs |\n| **Pesticides** | Urban applications | IPM programs, education |\n| **PCBs/Mercury** | Historical contamination | Source identification, sediment management |\n\n### TMDL Compliance Pathways (San Diego Example)\n\n1. **Wasteload Allocation Pathway** - Achieve specific effluent concentrations/loads\n2. **Receiving Water Pathway** - Demonstrate receiving water meets standards\n3. **Water Quality Improvement Plan** - Alternative compliance through approved plan\n\n### Time Schedule Orders",

Cities ≥100,000 are covered under regional Phase I permits. Contact your Regional Board or check the State Water Board's permit lists.\n\n**Q: What's the difference between MEP and numeric effluent limits?**\nA: MEP (Maximum Extent Practicable) is a programmatic standard requiring comprehensive implementation of BMPs. Numeric limits set specific concentration or load targets. MS4 permits increasingly include numeric limits through TMDL wasteload allocations.\n\n**Q: Can a small city get a waiver from Phase II requirements?**\nA: Potentially. MS4s serving <1,000 population within urbanized areas may apply for waivers if another MS4 already manages stormwater for that area. Contact the State Water Board.\n\n**Q: What if we can't meet TMDL deadlines?**\nA: Request a Time Schedule Order (TSO) from your Regional Board. TSOs establish phased compliance with interim milestones while you implement additional controls.\n\n**Q: Who is responsible when multiple cities share a watershed?**\nA: Co-permittees share watershed-level responsibilities while maintaining individual responsibility for their jurisdictions. Regional permits typically assign specific roles through permit language and watershed group coordination.",

If you discharge to land or groundwater only, you typically need a WDR. Contact your Regional Board for specific guidance.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to get an individual permit?**\nA: Plan for 6+ months minimum. Complex facilities or contested permits can take significantly longer.\n\n**Q: What happens if I discharge without a permit?**\nA: Unauthorized discharges violate the Clean Water Act. Penalties can include administrative fines up to $10,000/day/violation and civil penalties up to $25,000/day/violation.\n\n**Q: Can I operate while my permit renewal is pending?**\nA: Yes, if you submitted a complete renewal application at least 180 days before expiration. Your existing permit is \"administratively continued.\"",

Private investors provide upfront capital\n2. Funds transfer to project implementer\n3. Environmental intervention produces outcomes\n4. Beneficiaries reimburse costs plus interest based on performance\n5. Interest rate can be predetermined or performance-based\n\n**Key Distinction from Green Bonds:**\n- Green bonds: Fixed repayment regardless of project performance\n- EIBs: Compensation indexed to forecasted and realized environmental benefits\n\n**Repayment Sources:**\n- Cost savings (reduced cleanup costs, more efficient regulatory compliance)\n- Financial benefits (reduced flooding, enhanced revenues, increased tax base)\n\n### DC Water: America's First EIB (Model Case Study)\n\n**Background:**\n- Combined sewer overflows dumped 2.5 billion gallons annually into DC rivers\n- 2005 EPA consent decree required addressing sewer overflow\n- Initial plan: Multi-billion dollar grey infrastructure\n\n**EIB Structure:**\n- **Bond Amount:** $25 million\n- **Investors:** Goldman Sachs and Calvert Impact Capital\n- **Project:** 25 acres of green infrastructure pilot\n- **Transaction Intermediary:** Quantified Ventures\n\n**Green Infrastructure Components:**\n- Permeable pavement\n- Green roofs\n- Landscaped retention facilities\n\n**Performance Targets:**\n- Capture approximately 650,000 gallons of water annually\n- Reduce runoff into Rock Creek by targeted amount\n\n**Results:**\n- Green infrastructure reduced runoff by nearly 20% over five years\n- Outperformed expectations\n- Spring 2021: Full repayment with no penalty\n- Demonstrated EIBs work in water infrastructure\n\n**Co-Benefits:**\n- New green spaces at multiple locations\n- Construction employment opportunities\n- Green infrastructure workforce certification program",

Beneficial Uses\n\nBeneficial uses represent the public and private purposes for which water can be used and protected. California Water Code Section 13050(f) provides the statutory foundation, defining these as uses that \"may be protected against water quality degradation.\"\n\n**Categories of Beneficial Uses:**\n- Municipal and domestic supply (MUN)\n- Agricultural supply (AGR)\n- Industrial service supply (IND)\n- Hydropower generation (POW)\n- Water contact recreation (REC-1)\n- Non-contact recreation (REC-2)\n- Commercial and sport fishing (COMM)\n- Cold freshwater habitat (COLD)\n- Warm freshwater habitat (WARM)\n- Wildlife habitat (WILD)\n- Rare, threatened, or endangered species (RARE)\n- Fish spawning (SPWN)\n- Estuarine habitat (EST)\n- Marine habitat (MAR)\n- Navigation (NAV)\n- Groundwater recharge (GWR)\n\n**Tribal Beneficial Uses (Added 2017):**\n- Tribal Traditional Culture (CUL)\n- Tribal Subsistence Fishing (T-SUB)\n- Subsistence Fishing (SUB)\n\n### 2. Water Quality Objectives\n\nWater quality objectives are the limits or levels of water quality constituents established for reasonable protection of beneficial uses. California Water Code Section 13050(h) requires these be established for all waters within Regional Board jurisdictions.\n\nWater quality objectives come in two forms:\n- **Numeric objectives**: Specific quantitative thresholds (e.g., pH 6.5-8.5, dissolved oxygen ≥5.0 mg/L)\n- **Narrative objectives**: Qualitative descriptions of required conditions (e.g., \"free from toxic substances\")\n\n### 3.

This watershed-based approach reflects the fundamental reality that:\n\n- Water moves through natural drainage patterns\n- Water quality management is most effective when authority aligns with natural basins\n- Different regions have significantly different climates, topography, geology, and hydrology\n\n### Collective Jurisdiction\n\nThe nine Regional Boards together govern:\n- **1.6 million acres** of lakes\n- **1.3 million acres** of bays and estuaries\n- **211,000 miles** of rivers and streams\n- **~1,100 miles** of California coastline\n- All groundwater resources",

This distinguishes appropriative rights from riparian rights, which attach to land through proximity to a water body.\n\nWater in California is not privately owned. The right to use water is a **usufructuary right**—a right to use something but not to own it. Appropriative rights holders possess no property interest in the water itself but have the legal right to divert and use a certain quantity under specified conditions.\n\nKey characteristics of appropriative rights:\n- Exist regardless of relationship between land and water\n- Depend on physical control and beneficial use\n- May be sold or transferred to another user\n- Allow long-term storage of water (unlike riparian rights)\n- Can transport water outside the natural watershed",

This doctrine establishes:\n\n- Priority is determined by the date the appropriator first manifests intent to develop the right\n- Not determined by when water actually begins to be used\n- Not determined by the size of the water right\n- The priority date is fixed and does not change even if the right is transferred or sold\n\n**Priority During Shortages:**\nWhen water supplies diminish, junior rights are restricted before senior rights:\n1. Most recently established rights are curtailed first\n2. Older rights are curtailed only if shortage continues\n3. Pre-1914 appropriators have higher priority than post-1914 appropriators\n4.

    "chunk_text": "# Appropriative Water Rights Overview\n\n## Historical Development\n\n### Gold Rush Origins (1848-1855)\n\nCalifornia's appropriative rights system emerged from the California Gold Rush beginning in January 1848. Gold mining required enormous quantities of water for hydraulic and placer mining operations.\n\nMiners faced unique challenges:\n- Gold deposits were dispersed across public lands\n- Water was scarce in certain mining regions\n- No governmental authority existed to regulate water use\n- Eastern riparian doctrine did not fit mining conditions\n\n**Mining Practice Established:**\nMiners developed a system of posting notice at the point of diversion to stake water claims, analogous to staking land claims for gold. This custom was later affirmed by California courts.\n\n### Irwin v. Phillips (1855)\n\nThe landmark California Supreme Court decision in **Irwin v. Phillips** (1855) established appropriative rights doctrine as California law:\n\n- Held that on public mineral lands, prior appropriation governs water rights\n- Granted the right to divert water for mining to the first appropriator\n- First appropriator's rights superior even against subsequent claimants of riparian land\n- Rejected application of common law riparian doctrine to California's circumstances\n\nThe court recognized that:\n- Common law protecting natural streamflow developed where water was abundant\n- California's mining regions required different rules\n- Miners had invested substantial capital in water infrastructure\n- The \"first in time, first in right\" principle better served justice\n\n### Water Commission Act of 1913\n\nFor decades, California's appropriative rights system operated without formal governmental oversight. By the early 20th century, conflicts multiplied and systematic allocation became necessary.",

California's water resources must be put to **beneficial use** to the fullest extent possible\n2. **Waste and unreasonable use** must be prevented\n3. **Conservation** must be pursued with a view toward reasonable and beneficial use\n4.

Rights do not extend to waste, unreasonable use, or unreasonable method of diversion\n\n### Significance\n\nBefore this amendment, riparian rights holders were not required to put water to reasonable and beneficial use. The constitutional amendment resolved this conflict by:\n\n- Imposing reasonable and beneficial use requirements on **all** water appropriations\n- Applying to both riparian and appropriative rights\n- Providing the State Water Board with authority to:\n  - Investigate water use\n  - Determine whether use is reasonable\n  - Take action to prevent waste and unreasonable use\n\nThe California Supreme Court has interpreted Article X, Section 2 as **self-executing**—requiring all branches of government and administrative agencies to implement its principles.",

Chronic Lowering of Groundwater Levels\n\n- Persistent decline in groundwater levels over time\n- Indicates extraction exceeds recharge\n- Threatens long-term water availability\n- Damages drinking water wells (especially small domestic wells)\n\n### 2. Reduction of Groundwater Storage\n\n- Significant decline in water volume stored within basin\n- Recharge insufficient to maintain storage\n- Depletes groundwater reserves\n- Cannot maintain current extraction indefinitely\n\n### 3. Seawater Intrusion\n\n- Affects coastal groundwater basins\n- Overdraft reduces hydraulic pressure\n- Saltwater flows inland into freshwater aquifers\n- Often **irreversible** and costly to remediate\n- Contaminates water supplies for millions of Californians\n\n### 4. Degraded Water Quality\n\n- Point-source contamination (industrial, storage tanks)\n- Non-point source contamination (agricultural chemicals)\n- Prevents increases in contaminant concentrations\n- Prevents migration of contaminant plumes\n\n### 5. Land Subsidence\n\n- Occurs when water removal causes fine-grained sediments to compact\n- Can lower land surface by inches to feet\n- **Irreversible** in most cases\n- Damages infrastructure: canals, roads, buildings\n- Extensive in San Joaquin Valley\n\n### 6. Depletion of Interconnected Surface Waters\n\n- Groundwater and surface water are often connected\n- Groundwater discharge maintains stream flows during dry seasons\n- Excessive pumping depletes surface flows\n- Harms aquatic ecosystems, fisheries, instream uses\n- **Most technically challenging** to assess and manage",

Adverse impacts on habitats and streamflows\n\n### Why Focus on High/Medium Priority?\n\nThe 94 high- and medium-priority basins account for:\n- **98%** of California's total groundwater pumping (~20 million acre-feet/year)\n- **83%** of state's population (~25 million people)\n- **88%** of irrigated acres (~6.7 million acres)\n\n### Critically Overdrafted Basins\n\nWithin high/medium priority basins, **21 basins** are designated as **critically overdrafted**:\n- Experienced severe groundwater depletion\n- Face accelerated compliance timelines\n- GSPs due January 31, 2020 (two years earlier than others)\n- Must achieve sustainability by January 31, 2040",

Notice of Intent to Appropriate\n\nEither:\n- **Formal notice**: Filed with county or posted at point of diversion\n- **Informal notice**: Visible manifestation of intent (constructing dam, canal, or diversion works)\n\n### 2. Actual Diversion of Water\n\n- Real extraction of water, not merely prospective\n- Physical infrastructure to capture and convey water\n- Cannot be speculative or theoretical\n\n### 3. Steps Taken Prior to 1914\n\n- Evidence of appropriation activities before December 19, 1914\n- Any appropriation beginning after 1914 required Water Commission approval\n\n### 4. Beneficial Use\n\n- Water must be applied to a legitimate beneficial purpose\n- Examples: irrigation, domestic use, mining, municipal supply\n\n### 5. Quantification\n\n- Specific amount of water actually diverted and beneficially used\n- Amount determined by actual historical use, not by claims",
