You might pay one, both, or neither.\n\n## Family Fee\n\n### What It Is\nA family fee is an income-based payment that families receiving subsidized child care pay **to the subsidy program** (through your Alternative Payment Program or contractor).\n\n### Key Facts About Family Fees\n- Based on your family size and income\n- Calculated using a state fee schedule\n- One fee per family, regardless of number of children\n- Maximum is 1% of monthly income\n- Zero fee if income is below 75% of State Median Income\n- Collected by or on behalf of the subsidy program\n\n### Who Sets Family Fees?\nThe California Department of Education (CDE) sets the family fee schedule statewide.\n\n### Who Pays Family Fees?\nFamilies in:\n- CalWORKs Stages 2 and 3\n- Alternative Payment Programs (APP)\n- General Child Care (CCTR)\n- Other state-subsidized programs\n\n### Who Does NOT Pay Family Fees?\n- Families below 75% SMI (no fee)\n- CalWORKs Stage 1 (exempt)\n- Families receiving CalWORKs cash aid (exempt)\n- Children in foster care or CPS (exempt)\n- Families experiencing homelessness (exempt in some counties)\n\n## Co-Payment\n\n### What It Is\nA co-payment is the difference between what your child care provider charges and the maximum rate the subsidy program will pay (called the Regional Market Rate Ceiling or RMRC).\n\n### Key Facts About Co-Payments\n- Varies by provider (each sets their own rates)\n- Paid directly to your provider\n- Can vary by age of child, schedule, program type\n- NOT set by income\n- Some providers don't charge any co-pay\n- Can change if provider raises rates\n\n### Who Sets Co-Payments?\n**The provider.** If a provider's rate exceeds the state maximum reimbursement (RMRC), the provider can choose whether to:\n- Accept the RMRC as payment in full (no co-pay)\n- Charge the difference as a co-payment\n\n### Example\n| | Amount |\n|---|---|\n| Provider's monthly rate | $2,000 |\n| RMRC (max subsidy pays) | $1,800 |\n| **Co-payment (if charged)** | **$200** |\n\n## Comparing Family Fees and Co-Payments\n\n| | Family Fee | Co-Payment |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Based on** | Family income | Provider's rate vs RMRC |\n| **Paid to** | Subsidy program/agency | Provider directly |\n| **Set by** | State fee schedule | Provider choice |\n| **Same for all kids?** | Yes (one fee) | No (varies by provider) |\n| **Can it be zero?** | Yes (if income low enough) | Yes (if provider accepts RMRC) |\n| **Required?** | If income above 75% SMI | Only if provider charges it |\n\n## Can You Pay Both?\n\n**Yes!** A family can pay both:\n1. A family fee to the subsidy program (based on income)\n2. A co-payment to the provider (if provider charges above RMRC)\n\n### Example: Family Paying Both\n- Family of 4, income at 80% SMI\n- **Family fee:** ~$85/month (based on income)\n- Provider rate: $2,200/month\n- RMRC: $1,900/month\n- **Co-payment:** $300/month (provider's choice to charge)\n- **Total out-of-pocket:** $385/month\n\n### Example: Family Paying Neither\n- Family of 4, income at 60% SMI (below 75%)\n- **Family fee:** $0 (income too low)\n- Provider rate: $1,800/month\n- RMRC: $1,900/month\n- **Co-payment:** $0 (provider rate is below RMRC)\n- **Total out-of-pocket:** $0\n\n## Tips to Minimize Costs\n\n### To Avoid or Reduce Co-Payments:\n- Ask providers upfront about co-payments before enrolling\n- Look for providers who accept the RMRC as full payment\n- Some licensed family child care homes charge less than centers\n- Resource & Referral agencies can help you find affordable providers\n\n### To Reduce Family Fees:\n- Report income decreases to your agency immediately\n- Know if you qualify for fee exemptions (CPS, homelessness, etc.)\n- Ensure your family size is correctly documented\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Provider\n\n1. Do you accept the subsidy rate as full payment?\n2. If you charge a co-pay, how much is it?\n3. Does the co-pay vary by age or schedule?\n4. Do you have a sliding scale or reduce co-pays for low-income families?\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Subsidy Agency\n\n1. What is my family fee based on my current income?\n2. Do I qualify for any fee exemptions?\n3. How is my family fee collected?\n4. If my income changes, how quickly will my fee change?\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Your local Resource & Referral agency:** Help finding affordable providers\n- **Your Alternative Payment Program:** Questions about family fees\n- **CDE Family Fee Schedule:** cde.ca.gov (search \"family fee schedule\")\n- **211:** Dial 2-1-1 for local child care resources",
