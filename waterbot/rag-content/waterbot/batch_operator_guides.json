California requires TMF assessments for new systems, ownership changes, and funding applications. The [Division of Drinking Water](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html) administers these requirements.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\n- Required by state and federal law (SDWA 1996)\n- Demonstrates long-term viability\n- Identifies gaps before they become crises\n- Required for most funding programs\n\n## Technical Capacity\n\nTechnical capacity means having the physical infrastructure and expertise to deliver safe water consistently.\n\n### Key Elements\n\n**Source Capacity**\n- Can your sources meet maximum day demand?\n- Do you have backup supply options?\n- Are sources properly protected from contamination?\n\n**Treatment**\n- Is treatment adequate for source water quality?\n- Are treatment processes properly operated?\n- Is treatment equipment maintained?\n\n**Distribution**\n- Is system pressure adequate throughout?\n- Are there dead-ends or low-flow areas?\n- Are there sufficient isolation valves?\n\n**Certified Operators**\n- Do you have the required operator grades?\n- Is coverage adequate for system needs?\n- Is there backup operator coverage?\n- Is continuing education current?\n\n**System Documentation**\n- Are as-built drawings current?\n- Is operations and maintenance (O&M) plan complete?\n- Is monitoring plan established?\n\n### Self-Assessment Questions\n\n1. Can we produce enough water on our peak demand day?\n2. Do we have certified operators for our system classification?\n3. Do we have an operations plan that operators follow?\n4. Are our as-built drawings accurate and accessible?\n5. Do we have a monitoring schedule that meets requirements?\n\n## Managerial Capacity\n\nManagerial capacity means having clear ownership, effective governance, and proper planning.\n\n### Key Elements\n\n**Clear Ownership**\n- Is ownership legally documented?\n- Are water rights established?\n- Is service area defined?\n\n**Governance**\n- Are roles and responsibilities clear?\n- Is there a governing board (if required)?\n- Are meetings held regularly?\n- Are records maintained?\n\n**Planning**\n- Is there a capital improvement plan?\n- Is there an emergency response plan?\n- Is there a consumer confidence report process?\n- Are regulatory contacts current?\n\n### Self-Assessment Questions\n\n1. Is our ownership structure clearly documented?\n2. Do we have written policies for operations?\n3. Do we have an emergency response plan?\n4. Do we know who our regulatory contacts are?\n5. Are we meeting all reporting requirements?\n\n## Financial Capacity\n\nFinancial capacity means having adequate revenue, sound budgeting, and reserves for the future.\n\n### Key Elements\n\n**Revenue Structure**\n- Are rates set to cover all costs?\n- When were rates last reviewed?\n- Is there a rate-setting process?\n\n**Budgeting**\n- Is there an annual budget?\n- Are actual expenses tracked against budget?\n- Is there budget control (dual signature, oversight)?\n\n**Reserves**\n- Operating reserve (3-6 months O&M)\n- Emergency reserve\n- Capital improvement reserve\n- Debt service reserve (if applicable)\n\n**Financial Management**\n- Are finances audited annually?\n- Is there separation of duties?\n- Are records maintained properly?\n\n### Self-Assessment Questions\n\n1. Do our rates cover our full cost of service?\n2. Do we have a 5-year budget projection?\n3. Do we have reserves for emergencies?\n4. Do we have a capital improvement fund?\n5. When did we last review our rate structure?\n\n## Where to Get the Forms\n\n### Standard TMF Assessment\n- [State Water Board TMF page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html)\n- Community systems and nontransient noncommunity systems\n\n### TMF E-Z Form\n- For transient noncommunity systems meeting specific criteria\n- Simpler documentation requirements\n- Same website location\n\n## Getting Help\n\n### Free Technical Assistance\n\n**For Small DACs (Disadvantaged Communities):**\n- Office of Sustainable Water Solutions: DFA-TARequest@waterboards.ca.gov\n- [Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC)](https://www.rcac.org/events/drinking-water-compliance/)\n- Self-Help Enterprises (San Joaquin Valley)\n\n**For All Small Systems:**\n- California Rural Water Association: calruralwater.org\n- [EPA TMF Capacity Development program](https://www.epa.gov/dwcapacity)\n\n## Common Gaps and Solutions\n\n| Common Gap | Solution |\n|------------|----------|\n| No certified operator | Hire operator or contract with neighboring system |\n| No emergency plan | Use State Board sample template |\n| Rates too low | Conduct rate study, phase in increases |\n| No reserves | Start with small percentage of revenue |\n| No capital plan | Inventory assets, estimate replacement costs |\n| Outdated drawings | Apply for technical assistance grant |\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Download the TMF assessment forms** from the [DDW Small Water Systems page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html) \u2014 use the standard form for community systems or the E-Z form for qualifying transient systems.\n2. **Complete all three sections** (Technical, Managerial, Financial) honestly \u2014 gaps identified now can be addressed before they become compliance failures.\n3. **Request free technical assistance** from [RCAC](https://www.rcac.org/events/drinking-water-compliance/) or the [EPA Capacity Development program](https://www.epa.gov/dwcapacity) if you need help filling gaps in any TMF area.\n4. **Use the assessment to pursue funding** \u2014 most state and federal water infrastructure grants require a completed TMF assessment as part of the application.",

      "content": "# Water System Consolidation Pathways in California\n\n## What is Consolidation?\n\nConsolidation is the merging of two or more water systems, either physically (connecting infrastructure) or managerially (sharing management). It's one solution for small systems struggling with compliance, costs, or capacity.\n\n## Why Consider Consolidation?\n\n### Benefits\n- Share operational costs\n- Access more qualified operators\n- Achieve economies of scale\n- Meet compliance requirements\n- Access better funding options\n- Provide more reliable service\n\n### When It Makes Sense\n- System within 1 mile of larger system\n- Repeated compliance violations\n- Cannot afford needed improvements\n- Lack technical/managerial capacity\n- Operator shortage\n- Aging infrastructure beyond repair\n\n## Types of Consolidation\n\n### Physical Consolidation\n- Actual connection of water systems\n- Subsumed system receives water from receiving system\n- Original source may be abandoned or remain backup\n- Most common type\n\n### Managerial Consolidation\n- Systems remain physically separate\n- One system manages both\n- Shared operators, administration, billing\n- Maintains local ownership/identity\n\n### Extension of Service\n- Existing system extends to new area\n- Similar to physical consolidation\n- Often for unserved areas (domestic wells, state smalls)\n\n## Voluntary vs. Mandatory\n\n### Voluntary Consolidation\n- Negotiated between systems\n- More flexible terms\n- State provides funding assistance\n- Faster process typically\n- Preferred approach\n\n### Mandatory Consolidation (SB 88)\n- [State Water Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/) can require\n- For systems that \"consistently fail\"\n- 6-month voluntary negotiation period\n- Board order if no agreement\n- Receiving system compensated\n\n**Consistently Failing Means:**\n- Repeated violations of drinking water standards\n- Failure to provide safe, reliable water\n- Demonstrated inability to achieve compliance\n\n## The Consolidation Process\n\n### Step 1: Feasibility Assessment\n- Is consolidation feasible?\n- Physical distance between systems\n- Capacity of receiving system\n- Cost of connection infrastructure\n- Regulatory requirements\n\n**Feasibility Factors:**\n- Geographical separation\n- Topography (can gravity work?)\n- Capacity of receiving system\n- Water quality compatibility\n- Infrastructure condition\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Partners\n- Neighboring water systems\n- County or city systems\n- Special districts\n- Investor-owned utilities\n- Private companies\n\n### Step 3: Negotiation\n- Terms of consolidation\n- Rate impacts on both systems\n- Infrastructure responsibilities\n- Governance changes\n- Timeline\n\n### Step 4: Funding\n- State funding available (SAFER, DWSRF)\n- Grants for disadvantaged communities\n- Loans for non-disadvantaged\n- Technical assistance for planning\n\n### Step 5: Implementation\n- Engineering and design\n- Environmental review\n- Construction\n- System integration\n- Customer transition\n\n## Funding for Consolidation\n\n### SAFER Program\n- Primary source for DAC consolidations\n- Planning grants\n- Construction funding\n- Technical assistance\n- [SAFER program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/safer/)\n\n### Drinking Water SRF\n- Low-interest loans\n- Principal forgiveness for DACs\n- Covers infrastructure costs\n\n### Proposition 1\n- Bond funding for water projects\n- Consolidation eligible\n\n## Liability Protection\n\nSB 88 provides liability relief for receiving systems:\n- Not responsible for prior violations of subsumed system\n- Protection for water quality inherited\n- Applies to voluntary and mandatory\n- Removes a major barrier\n\n## Alternatives to Consolidation\n\n### Regional Partnerships\n- Shared services (operations, billing)\n- Joint purchasing\n- Mutual aid agreements\n- Not full consolidation\n\n### Contract Operations\n- Hire professional operator\n- Maintain ownership\n- Access expertise without merger\n\n### Administrator Appointment\n- State appoints administrator for failing systems\n- Temporary measure\n- May lead to consolidation\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Contact Points\n- [Division of Drinking Water](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/waterpartnership.html) district office\n- Office of Sustainable Water Solutions\n- [Rural Community Assistance Corporation](https://www.rcac.org/events/drinking-water-compliance/)\n- Potential receiving systems\n\n### Questions to Ask\n1. Is there a system within feasible distance?\n2. What would connection infrastructure cost?\n3. What funding is available?\n4. How would rates be affected?\n5. What's the timeline?\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Assess feasibility** \u2014 contact the [DDW Consolidation and Extension of Service program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/waterpartnership.html) to determine if physical or managerial consolidation is viable for your system.\n2. **Explore funding** through the [SAFER program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/safer/) \u2014 grants are available for disadvantaged communities pursuing consolidation, covering planning, design, and construction.\n3. **Review the compliance pathway** at the [DDW Compliance and Enforcement page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/) to understand mandatory consolidation triggers and voluntary negotiation timelines.\n4. **Contact potential partner systems** and request technical assistance from [RCAC](https://www.rcac.org/events/drinking-water-compliance/) to evaluate connection infrastructure costs and rate impacts.",
