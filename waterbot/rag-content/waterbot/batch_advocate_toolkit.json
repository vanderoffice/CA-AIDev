      "content": "# How to Use CIWQS to Research Water Quality Violations\n\n## What is CIWQS?\n\nCIWQS (California Integrated Water Quality System) is the State Water Board's database for tracking permits, inspections, violations, and enforcement actions. It's a powerful free tool for community advocates researching water quality issues in their area.\n\n**Access:** [CIWQS Public Portal](https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov)\n\n## Key Features for Community Research\n\n### Facility-At-A-Glance Reports\n- Search by facility name, location, or permit number\n- Shows permit status, inspection history, violations\n- Links to actual permit documents\n- Monitoring data submitted by facilities\n\n### Interactive Violation Reports\n- Filter violations by county, water board region, or time period\n- See violation type, severity, and resolution status\n- Track patterns of non-compliance\n- Export data for your own analysis\n\n### eSMR (Electronic Self-Monitoring Reports)\n- Monthly/quarterly data reported by permitted facilities\n- Pollutant levels, flow rates, compliance status\n- Compare reported levels to permit limits\n\n## Step-by-Step: Researching a Facility\n\n### Step 1: Find the Facility\n1. Go to the [CIWQS public portal](https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov)\n2. Click \"Facility Search\" or \"Regulated Facility Report\"\n3. Search by name, address, or region\n4. Note the CIWQS Place ID for future reference\n\n### Step 2: Review Permit Information\n1. Click on the facility to open details\n2. Find the associated permit (NPDES, WDR, etc.)\n3. Download the actual permit document\n4. Note the permit limits for key pollutants\n\n### Step 3: Check Violation History\n1. Use \"Violation Summary\" or \"Violation Report\"\n2. Filter by date range (last 5 years is typical)\n3. Note violation categories:\n   - Category 1: Serious (human health impact)\n   - Category 2: Significant non-compliance\n   - Category 3: Minor violations\n\n### Step 4: Review Enforcement Actions\n1. Check for Notices of Violation (NOVs)\n2. Look for Administrative Civil Liability (ACL) orders\n3. Note any Cleanup and Abatement Orders\n4. Track resolution and penalty amounts\n\n## Tips for Effective Research\n\n### What to Look For\n- Repeated violations of same permit limit\n- Violations that go unaddressed for months\n- Gaps in monitoring data (missed reports)\n- Patterns suggesting systemic problems\n\n### Documenting Your Findings\n- Save PDFs of key reports\n- Note CIWQS Place ID and permit numbers\n- Create timeline of violations\n- Compare to permit limits\n\n### Limitations\n- Data entry delays (can be 1-3 months behind)\n- Not all facilities are in CIWQS\n- Some data requires interpretation\n- Historical data may be incomplete\n\n## Using CIWQS Data\n\n### For Public Comments\n- Reference specific violations by date and type\n- Quote permit limits vs actual reported values\n- Document patterns over time\n\n### For Formal Complaints\n- Attach CIWQS printouts as evidence\n- Reference violation tracking numbers\n- Note enforcement (or lack thereof)\n\n### For Community Meetings\n- Create simple charts from exported data\n- Focus on most serious (Category 1) violations\n- Show trends over time\n\n## Related Resources\n- [CIWQS User Guide](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ciwqs/) (available on Water Board website)\n- Regional Board staff can help interpret data\n- Community Water Center offers CIWQS training\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Start your research** at the [CIWQS public portal](https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov) \u2014 search by facility name, location, or permit number to find violation histories and enforcement actions.\n2. **Learn the system** using the [CIWQS program guide](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ciwqs/) for tutorials on navigating facility reports, violation summaries, and eSMR data.\n3. **Document patterns** \u2014 save PDFs of key reports, note CIWQS Place IDs, and create timelines of violations for use in public comments or formal complaints.\n4. **Attend a Water Board meeting** to present your findings \u2014 reference specific violations by date, type, and tracking number for maximum impact.",
