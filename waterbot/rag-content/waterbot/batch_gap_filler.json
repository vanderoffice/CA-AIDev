California requires proper well destruction following standards in DWR Bulletin 74, as detailed at the [DWR Well Standards](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/Wells/Well-Standards/Combined-Well-Standards) page.\n\n## Why Proper Abandonment Matters\n\nAn improperly sealed well can allow surface water, pesticides, fertilizers, and bacteria to reach groundwater supplies. Wells also pose physical safety hazards. Property transfers may trigger mandatory destruction requirements.\n\n## California Requirements\n\nAll well destruction must follow [Well Destruction Standards](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/Wells/Well-Standards/Combined-Well-Standards/Water-Destruction), which include obtaining a county permit, using a licensed C-57 well drilling contractor, filling with approved sealing materials, and filing a completion report with the county and DWR.\n\n## Process and Costs\n\nThe destruction process involves removing the pump and casing if needed, cleaning the well, filling with approved grout or cement, installing a surface seal, and reporting to the county. Costs range from hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on well depth and complexity. The [DWR Wells Program](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/Wells) provides additional guidance.\n\n## Take Action\n1. Review well construction and destruction standards at [DWR Well Standards](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/Wells/Well-Standards/Combined-Well-Standards).\n2. Check specific destruction requirements at [Well Destruction Standards](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/Wells/Well-Standards/Combined-Well-Standards/Water-Destruction).\n3. Find licensed well contractors through the [DWR Wells Program](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/Wells).\n4.

The [SWAMP Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/) conducts statewide sediment monitoring using standardized methods.\n\n## Contaminants of Concern\n\nKey sediment contaminants include metals (mercury, copper, zinc), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT and metabolites, and other persistent organic pollutants. The [Water Quality Goals](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/water_quality_goals/) database provides applicable screening levels.\n\n## Take Action\n1. Review sediment quality policies at [Plans and Policies - Sediment Quality](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/plans_policies/).\n2. Access sediment monitoring data through the [SWAMP Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/).\n3. Look up sediment screening levels in the [Water Quality Goals](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/water_quality_goals/) database.\n4. Contact your Regional Water Board for site-specific sediment quality assessments.\n5. Include sediment sampling in any waterway restoration or dredging project planning.",

The [TMDL Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/tmdl/) has established temperature TMDLs for several California rivers where elevated temperatures impair aquatic habitat and reduce dissolved oxygen levels.\n\n## Why Temperature Matters\n\nExcessive water temperatures reduce dissolved oxygen availability, increase metabolic stress on coldwater fish, disrupt spawning timing, and can be lethal during extreme events. Even modest increases can shift community structure away from sensitive species.\n\n## Sources of Temperature Increase\n\nKey sources include thermal discharge from power plants, reduced riparian shading from vegetation removal, dam operations that alter thermal regimes, urban heat island effects, and climate change. The [TMDL Background](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/tmdl/background.html) explains how temperature load allocations are developed.\n\n## California Examples\n\nTemperature TMDLs have been established for the Klamath River, Russian River, and other watercourses with salmonid habitat. Management approaches include shade restoration through riparian planting, modified dam operations, thermal discharge limits, and strategic water release temperature management. These requirements are implemented through [Plans and Policies](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/plans_policies/).\n\n## Take Action\n1.

The [Stormwater Grants - SWRCB](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/grants_loans/swgp/) program provides one funding avenue.\n\n## Prop 218 Challenges\n\nStormwater fees are subject to Proposition 218 requirements: written notice to affected property owners, 45-day notice period, public hearing, and a majority protest provision that can block fee adoption. SB 231 (2017) clarified that stormwater is a \"property-related service\" eligible for fee-based funding.\n\n## Fee Structures\n\nCommon approaches include flat fees per parcel, impervious area-based fees (most equitable), tiered rates by development intensity, and assessment districts. Each approach has different legal and administrative considerations.\n\n## Alternative and Supplemental Funding\n\nBeyond local fees, options include general fund allocations, developer impact fees, state grant programs through [CASQA Stormwater Funding Resources](https://www.casqa.org/resources), Proposition 1 and 68 grants, and regional funding partnerships.\n\n## Take Action\n1.
