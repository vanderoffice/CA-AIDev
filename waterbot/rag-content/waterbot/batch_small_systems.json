      "content": "# Water System Consolidation Options\n\nConsolidation -- combining water systems to improve service, compliance, and sustainability -- is a key strategy in California's approach to solving the small water system crisis. The [DDW Mandatory Consolidation Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/) gives the State Board authority to mandate consolidation for chronically failing systems.\n\n## Types of Consolidation\n\n### Physical Consolidation\nActual pipeline connections between systems where one system provides water to another. Requires infrastructure investment but delivers the most complete integration.\n\n### Managerial Consolidation\nShared management and operations while systems remain physically separate. Contract services and shared operators reduce administrative burden and improve professional management.\n\n### Full Merger\nSystems become one legal entity with consolidated governance, operations, and finances. Provides the greatest economies of scale but requires the most complex organizational change.\n\n## Benefits\n- **Technical:** Shared expertise, better treatment, redundancy, economies of scale\n- **Financial:** Larger rate base, improved funding eligibility, shared costs\n- **Compliance:** Professional management, consistent operations, better monitoring\n\n## Mandatory Consolidation (SB 88)\nThe State Board can mandate consolidation for failing systems after other options are exhausted, prioritizing public health protection. The [SAFER Program - Consolidation](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/safer/) provides funding for mandated and voluntary consolidation projects.\n\n## Voluntary Consolidation Incentives\nPlanning grants, construction funding through [SWRCB Consolidation and Extension of Service](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/waterpartnership.html), technical assistance, and rate stabilization are available to incentivize voluntary consolidation.\n\n## Take Action\n1. Review consolidation program options at [DDW Mandatory Consolidation Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/).\n2. Explore funding for consolidation projects through the [SAFER Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/safer/).\n3. Learn about extension of service options at [SWRCB Consolidation and Extension of Service](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/waterpartnership.html).\n4. Contact your DDW district office to discuss which consolidation model fits your situation.\n5. Engage neighboring water systems early -- successful consolidation requires willing partners.",

      "content": "# Private Well Owner Responsibilities\n\nPrivate domestic wells serving a single residence are generally not regulated by the state in California. This means well owners bear full responsibility for water quality testing, well maintenance, and any treatment needed to ensure safe drinking water. The [DDW Private Well Information](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/well_owners.html) provides guidance, though enforcement falls to county environmental health departments.\n\n## Owner Responsibilities\n\n### Testing\nAnnual testing is recommended for coliform bacteria and nitrate, with broader mineral and contaminant analysis every 3-5 years. Testing should also occur after flooding, earthquakes, nearby contamination events, or any changes in taste, odor, or appearance. Use [GAMA Groundwater Information System](https://gamagroundwater.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/gamamap/public/) to check groundwater quality data in your area.\n\n### Maintenance\n- Protect the wellhead from contamination sources\n- Maintain proper grading to prevent surface water pooling\n- Monitor water level trends\n- Inspect the well annually for structural integrity\n\n### Treatment\nIf testing reveals contamination, the owner must install and maintain appropriate treatment -- point-of-use (under-sink) or point-of-entry (whole-house) systems. No state agency will provide treatment for private wells.\n\n## Well Construction Standards\nCounty permits are required for new wells, modifications, and destruction. Wells must meet DWR Bulletin 74 standards for construction, including setback requirements from septic systems and proper annular seals. The [EPA Private Drinking Water Wells](https://www.epa.gov/privatewells) provides additional guidance on well protection.\n\n## Finding Certified Labs\nTesting must be performed by ELAP-certified laboratories. Contact your county environmental health department or check the state lab directory for certified labs in your area.\n\n## Take Action\n1. Check groundwater conditions in your area at [DDW Private Well Information](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/well_owners.html).\n2. Review well protection guidance at [EPA Private Drinking Water Wells](https://www.epa.gov/privatewells).\n3. Search local groundwater quality data using the [GAMA Groundwater Information System](https://gamagroundwater.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/gamamap/public/).\n4. Test your well annually for bacteria and nitrate -- contact your county environmental health department for certified labs.\n5. If you're buying property with a well, request recent water quality testing results before closing.",

      "content": "# State Small Water System Permits\n\nState Small Water Systems (SSWS) serve 5-14 connections and fall below the federal threshold for Public Water System regulation. In California, these systems are regulated by local primacy agencies -- typically county environmental health departments -- under state-specific requirements established by the [DDW Small Water System Compliance](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html) program.\n\n## Regulatory Framework\n\nState Small Water Systems are not classified as Public Water Systems under federal law, but California imposes its own requirements including permits, water quality monitoring, and minimum facility standards. The [DDW Compliance and Enforcement](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/) program provides oversight when local agencies identify violations.\n\n## Operating Requirements\n\n### Water Quality\nSystems must meet primary drinking water standards, with testing frequency determined by the local agency. Results must be reported to the county, and violations trigger corrective action requirements.\n\n### Physical Standards\nSource protection, treatment (if needed), adequate storage capacity, and distribution system standards must all meet county requirements. The [EPA Small Drinking Water Systems Compliance](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo) provides supplementary federal guidance.\n\n## Permitting Process\n1. Apply to county environmental health department\n2. Submit to engineering review of system design\n3. Obtain construction permit and complete installation\n4. Pass final inspection\n5. Receive operating permit with ongoing conditions\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\nFailed water quality testing, operating without a permit, and inadequate facilities are the most common violations. Solutions include treatment installation, source improvement, or consolidation with a nearby Public Water System.\n\n## Take Action\n1. Review small system requirements at [DDW Small Water System Compliance](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html).\n2. Check compliance and enforcement standards at [DDW Compliance and Enforcement](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/).\n3. Access federal guidance at [EPA Small Drinking Water Systems Compliance](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo).\n4.

Because users change daily, monitoring focuses on acute health risks rather than chronic exposure. The [DDW Small Water System Compliance](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html) program oversees these systems.\n\n## Regulatory Requirements\n\n### Permit\nAll TNCWSs must hold an operating permit from DDW or the local primacy agency. Operating without a permit is a violation that can result in enforcement action through [DDW Compliance and Enforcement](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/).\n\n### Monitoring\n- Coliform bacteria testing: quarterly minimum\n- Nitrate: annually\n- Reduced monitoring compared to community systems, reflecting transient exposure patterns\n\n### Reporting\nSystems must submit monitoring results to their regulatory agency, notify of violations promptly, and complete annual reporting requirements.\n\n## Differences from Community Systems\nTNCWSs have reduced monitoring requirements and fewer contaminants monitored because different users don't accumulate chronic exposure. Regulatory focus emphasizes acute (immediate) health protection. The [EPA Small Drinking Water Systems Compliance](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo) explains the federal classification framework.\n\n## Common Violations\n- Monitoring and reporting failures (most common)\n- Coliform bacteria detections\n- Operating without a valid permit\n\n## Take Action\n1. Verify your system classification at [DDW Small Water System Compliance](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html).\n2.

The [DDW Small Water System Compliance](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/publicwatersystems.html) provides regulatory guidance.\n\n## More Stringent Requirements\nNTNCWSs must meet monitoring requirements similar to community systems because regular users accumulate chronic exposure. This includes monthly-to-quarterly coliform testing, annual nitrate monitoring, and testing for many additional contaminants on prescribed schedules.\n\n## Schools Specifically\nAB 746 requires lead testing at school drinking water outlets with an action level of 15 ppb. Schools exceeding the action level must remediate and report results publicly. These requirements apply regardless of whether the school is on a community water system or its own NTNCWS. [DDW Compliance and Enforcement](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/compliance/) tracks school testing compliance.\n\n## Common Challenges\n- Aging infrastructure in older school buildings\n- Limited dedicated funding for water system maintenance\n- Part-time operation with varying usage patterns\n- Multiple buildings creating complex distribution systems\n\n## Resources\nThe [EPA Small Drinking Water Systems Compliance](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo) provides guidance on federal requirements, monitoring schedules, and available technical assistance for NTNCWSs.\n\n## Take Action\n1.
