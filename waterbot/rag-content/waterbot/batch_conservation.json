      "content": "# 20x2020: California's Water Conservation Foundation\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nIn 2009, California passed a landmark law requiring the state to cut urban water use by 20% per person by 2020. Not only did we hit the target, we blew past it \u2014 achieving a 32% reduction statewide.\n\n## What Was SB X7-7?\n\nThe [Water Conservation Act of 2009 (SB X7-7)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920107SB7), signed by Governor Schwarzenegger, was California's first enforceable statewide water conservation mandate. It required every urban retail water supplier to:\n\n- Calculate a baseline of their per capita daily water use (averaged over 10-15 years ending between 2004-2010)\n- Set a 2020 target representing a 20% reduction from that baseline\n- Hit an interim target (10% reduction) by December 31, 2015\n- Achieve the full 20% reduction by December 31, 2020\n- Report progress through their [Urban Water Management Plans](https://water.ca.gov/programs/water-use-and-efficiency/sb-x7-7) (UWMPs)\n\nThe statewide baseline was approximately 199 gallons per capita per day (GPCD). The 20% reduction target set the statewide goal at 159 GPCD.\n\n## How Did Suppliers Set Their Targets?\n\nSuppliers chose one of four methods:\n\n| Method | How It Works |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Method 1** | Simply take 80% of baseline GPCD (straightforward 20% cut) |\n| **Method 2** | Set separate performance standards: 55 GPCD indoor + MWELO landscape standard + 10% CII reduction |\n| **Method 3** | Use 95% of the hydrologic region target from DWR's 20x2020 Plan |\n| **Method 4** | Use DWR-developed targets accounting for climate, density, and regional differences |\n\nSuppliers with baseline use above 100 GPCD had to reduce by at least 5% regardless of method chosen.\n\n## Did It Work?\n\nResoundingly yes:\n\n| Milestone | Target GPCD | Actual GPCD | Result |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|\n| **2015 Interim** | 183 | 133 | 27% below target |\n| **2020 Final** | 169 | 135 | 20% below target |\n\n- **374 of 386 suppliers (97%) met their 2020 targets**\n- Statewide per capita use dropped from 199 to about 135 GPCD \u2014 a 32% reduction\n- California used 20% less water than suppliers had planned for in their UWMPs in both 2015 and 2020\n\n## Why It Still Matters\n\nThe 20x2020 deadline has passed, but its legacy shaped everything that came after:\n\n- It proved that Californians could sustainably reduce water use\n- It created the data infrastructure (UWMPs, GPCD tracking) that the state still relies on\n- It directly led to [AB 1668 and SB 606 (2018)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html), which made conservation permanent \u2014 not just a 2020 deadline but a \"way of life\"\n- The indoor residential standard of 55 GPCD from Method 2 became the baseline for ongoing standards\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n20x2020 was California's proof of concept: mandatory conservation targets work. The program's success gave the state confidence to go further with permanent, enforceable efficiency standards that continue today.\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Review California's conservation track record** at the [Delta Stewardship Council Performance Dashboard](https://viewperformance.deltacouncil.ca.gov/pm/urban-water-use) to see how statewide per-capita water use has declined since 2009.\n2. **Look up your water supplier's conservation history** through [DWR's SB X7-7 program page](https://water.ca.gov/programs/water-use-and-efficiency/sb-x7-7) to find their baseline, targets, and actual performance.\n3. **Understand the current framework** that replaced 20x2020 \u2014 read about the [permanent conservation standards under AB 1668/SB 606](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html) that now govern your water supplier.",

      "content": "# Making Conservation a Way of Life: AB 1668 + SB 606\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nThese twin bills, signed in 2018, make water conservation permanent in California. Instead of emergency drought restrictions, every urban water supplier now has a custom water budget they must meet \u2014 with real penalties for missing it.\n\n## What Are AB 1668 and SB 606?\n\nAssembly Bill 1668 (Friedman) and Senate Bill 606 (Hertzberg), signed by Governor Brown in May 2018, are together called the \"Making Conservation a California Way of Life\" framework. They replaced the temporary, crisis-driven approach of 20x2020 with a permanent, supplier-level efficiency system.\n\nThe [State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html) adopted the implementing regulation on **July 3, 2024**. It took effect on **January 1, 2025**.\n\n## The Four Standards\n\nEvery urban water supplier's \"water use objective\" is a custom budget built from four components:\n\n### 1. Indoor Residential Use\n- Measured in gallons per capita per day (GPCD)\n- Current standard: **47 GPCD** (as of January 1, 2025)\n- Steps down further in 2030 (see SB 1157 document for details)\n- Calculated as: population served x GPCD standard x 365 days = annual indoor budget\n\n### 2. Outdoor Residential Use\n- Based on evapotranspiration (ET) \u2014 how much water plants actually need\n- Uses a Landscape Efficiency Factor (LEF) that tightens over time:\n  - Through June 30, 2035: LEF = **0.80**\n  - July 1, 2035 \u2013 June 30, 2040: LEF = **0.63**\n  - After July 1, 2040: LEF = **0.55**\n- Budget = LEF x Reference ET x Irrigable Area x Unit Conversion\n\n### 3. Water Loss\n- Based on an economic model (AWWA M36 methodology)\n- Each supplier gets a custom standard based on their system's characteristics\n- Tracks real losses (leaks) and apparent losses (meter errors, data handling)\n- Leak registry due January 1, 2029 (covering 2025-2027 data)\n\n### 4. Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional (CII)\n- CII landscapes with dedicated irrigation meters (DIMs) get their own budget\n- Through June 2028: actual water deliveries used\n- July 2028 \u2013 June 2035: LEF = 0.80\n- After July 2040: LEF = 0.45\n- Suppliers must classify CII customers using 22 categories\n- Large CII landscapes (500K+ gallons/year) must convert to DIMs by 2030\n\n## Who Must Comply?\n\nApproximately **[405 urban retail water suppliers](https://calwep.org/the-framework/)** serving about 95% of California's population. Exempt: irrigation-only suppliers, systems with fewer than 3,000 connections, and those delivering less than 3,000 acre-feet annually.\n\n## Enforcement Timeline\n\n| Date | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| January 1, 2025 | Regulation takes effect; first annual reports due |\n| January 2025 | SWRCB can issue written notices to non-compliant suppliers |\n| January 2026 | SWRCB can issue conservation orders |\n| After November 1, 2027 | Monetary penalties begin |\n| 2040 | Full compliance required |\n\n**Penalties**: Up to **$1,000 per day** for violations, or **$10,000 per day** during drought years.\n\n## What This Means for You\n\n- **The standards apply to your water supplier, not directly to you.** Your supplier sets rates and programs to meet their budget.\n- **Your rates may change.** Suppliers will likely use tiered rates or budget-based billing to encourage efficiency.\n- **More rebates and incentives.** Suppliers have strong motivation to help customers save water.\n- **No more drought-only conservation.** These standards apply rain or shine \u2014 conservation is now permanent.\n\n## The Big Goal\n\nThe framework \u2014 explained in detail by [CalWEP](https://calwep.org/the-framework/) \u2014 aims to reduce urban water consumption by approximately **400,000 acre-feet annually by 2030**, addressing the 10% water supply shortfall projected by 2040 due to climate change.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nAB 1668 and SB 606 shifted California from \"save water during droughts\" to \"use water efficiently all the time.\" Your water supplier now has a permanent, customized efficiency budget \u2014 and real consequences for missing it.\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Find your water supplier's efficiency plan** using the [SWRCB Water Conservation Portal](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html) \u2014 search for your supplier's annual report and water use objective.\n2. **Understand the framework** through [CalWEP's plain-language guide](https://calwep.org/the-framework/) to the four standards (indoor, outdoor, water loss, CII) and how they apply to your supplier.\n3. **Check your household's indoor use** against the 47 GPCD standard \u2014 divide your monthly indoor water bill by the number of people in your home and compare.\n4. **Contact your water supplier** to ask about conservation rebates, budget-based rates, and how they plan to meet their water use objective by 2027 (when penalties begin).",

      "content": "# SB 1157: California's Indoor Water Use Standards\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nSB 1157 (2022) tightened the indoor water use standard that your water supplier must meet. As of January 2025, the standard is 47 gallons per person per day \u2014 down from 55 \u2014 with further reductions coming.\n\n## What Is SB 1157?\n\n[Senate Bill 1157](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1157), authored by Senator Robert Hertzberg, was signed by Governor Newsom on **September 28, 2022**. It updated the indoor residential water use standard originally set by AB 1668/SB 606 (2018).\n\nSB 1157 doesn't replace the conservation framework \u2014 it strengthens one piece of it: the indoor residential use component.\n\n## The Standard Over Time\n\n| Period | Indoor Standard | Status |\n|--------|----------------|--------|\n| Through December 2024 | 55 GPCD | Completed |\n| January 1, 2025 onward | **47 GPCD** | Current |\n| January 2030 onward | Further reduction | Pending DWR report |\n\n### The 2030 Standard\n\nSB 1157 originally set an aspirational target of 42 GPCD by 2030. However, the law requires the [Department of Water Resources (DWR)](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Water-Use-And-Efficiency/2018-Water-Conservation-Legislation/Urban-Water-Use-Efficiency-Standards-Variances-and-Performance-Measures) to submit a **feasibility report to the Legislature by October 2028** evaluating whether that level is achievable. The adopted regulation currently sets the 2030 standard subject to this study.\n\n## What Counts as \"Indoor Residential Use\"?\n\nThe 47 GPCD standard covers water used inside your home:\n- Drinking and cooking\n- Bathing and showering\n- Toilet flushing\n- Laundry\n- Dishwashing\n- Indoor cleaning\n\nIt does **not** include:\n- Outdoor irrigation (covered by the outdoor standard)\n- Commercial or industrial use (covered by CII standards)\n- Water lost to system leaks (covered by water loss standard)\n\n## How 47 GPCD Translates to Real Life\n\nFor a household of 4 people at 47 GPCD:\n- Daily budget: 188 gallons\n- Monthly budget: approximately 5,640 gallons\n\nFor context, typical indoor water use breaks down roughly as:\n- Toilets: ~24% (high-efficiency models use 1.28 gallons per flush)\n- Showers: ~20% (WaterSense showerheads use \u22642.0 GPM)\n- Faucets: ~19%\n- Clothes washers: ~17% (ENERGY STAR models use ~13 gallons per load)\n- Leaks: ~12%\n- Other: ~8%\n\n## How This Affects Your Water Supplier\n\nYour supplier calculates their indoor water budget by multiplying:\n- Their service area population\n- The GPCD standard (currently 47)\n- 365 days per year\n\nThis produces an annual gallon budget for indoor residential use. If the supplier's actual indoor use exceeds this budget, they need to implement conservation programs \u2014 like rebates, education, or rate adjustments \u2014 to bring usage in line.\n\n## What This Means for You\n\n- **You won't be fined individually for exceeding 47 GPCD.** The standard applies to your supplier's total service area \u2014 track implementation at [CalWEP](https://calwep.org/timeline/indoor-residential-standard-drops-to-47-gpcd/).\n- **Your supplier may adjust rates** to incentivize indoor conservation (tiered pricing, budget-based rates).\n- **Rebates for efficient fixtures** become more common \u2014 toilets, showerheads, washing machines.\n- **Fixing leaks matters.** Indoor leaks account for about 12% of use and are the easiest savings.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nSB 1157 set a clear trajectory: Californians should use no more than 47 gallons per person per day indoors as of 2025, trending lower by 2030. This standard helps your water supplier build a realistic water budget \u2014 and gives them reason to offer you tools and incentives to save.\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Calculate your household's indoor water use** \u2014 divide your monthly indoor water consumption by the number of residents to see how you compare to the [47 GPCD standard](https://calwep.org/timeline/indoor-residential-standard-drops-to-47-gpcd/).\n2. **Fix leaks first** \u2014 indoor leaks account for ~12% of use and are the fastest path to savings.\n3. **Check for rebates on efficient fixtures** (toilets, showerheads, washing machines) from your local water supplier or through the [SaveOurWater.com Rebate Finder](https://saveourwater.com).\n4. **Track California's progress** on the indoor standard at [DWR's Urban Water Use Efficiency page](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Water-Use-And-Efficiency/2018-Water-Conservation-Legislation/Urban-Water-Use-Efficiency-Standards-Variances-and-Performance-Measures).",

      "content": "# Water Use Efficiency Standards Explained\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nCalifornia's water use efficiency framework sets specific numeric standards for indoor water use, outdoor landscaping, system water loss, and commercial/industrial irrigation \u2014 all getting progressively tighter through 2040.\n\n## The Complete Standards Timeline\n\nHere are all the key efficiency standards and when they apply:\n\n### Indoor Residential\n\n| Period | Standard |\n|--------|----------|\n| Through Dec 2024 | 55 gallons per capita per day (GPCD) |\n| Jan 2025 \u2013 Dec 2029 | **47 GPCD** |\n| Jan 2030 onward | Further reduction (pending DWR feasibility study, Oct 2028) |\n\nSuppliers calculate their indoor budget as: Population x GPCD Standard x 365 days.\n\n### Outdoor Residential (Landscape Efficiency Factor)\n\nThe [outdoor standard](https://calwep.org/outdoor-residential-standard/) uses a Landscape Efficiency Factor (LEF) multiplied by reference evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigable area:\n\n| Period | LEF | What It Means |\n|--------|-----|---------------|\n| Through June 30, 2035 | **0.80** | Landscapes can use 80% of reference ET |\n| July 1, 2035 \u2013 June 30, 2040 | **0.63** | Tighter \u2014 63% of reference ET |\n| After July 1, 2040 | **0.55** | Matches new-construction design standard |\n\nReference ET varies by climate zone. Hot inland areas have higher ET (more water allowed) than cool coastal areas.\n\n**What is \"reference evapotranspiration\"?** It's the amount of water a standard grass lawn needs based on temperature, humidity, wind, and sunlight. Multiply that by the LEF to get your landscape's water budget.\n\n### Water Loss (System Leaks)\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Standard type | Supplier-specific, calculated by economic model |\n| Methodology | AWWA M36 water audit \u2014 tracks real losses (leaks) and apparent losses (meter errors) |\n| Effective | Standards became effective in 2023 |\n| Leak registry | Due January 1, 2029 (covers 2025-2027 data) |\n| Questionnaires | Data quality, pressure management, and asset management |\n\nUnlike other standards, water loss standards must be met individually \u2014 suppliers can't offset excess water loss by saving in other categories.\n\n### CII Dedicated Irrigation Meters (DIM)\n\nCommercial, industrial, and institutional landscapes with dedicated irrigation meters:\n\n| Period | Standard |\n|--------|----------|\n| Through June 2028 | Actual water deliveries (baseline) |\n| July 2028 \u2013 June 2035 | LEF = **0.80** |\n| July 2035 \u2013 June 2040 | LEF = **0.63** |\n| After July 2040 | LEF = **0.45** |\n| New construction (any time) | LEF = **0.45** |\n\nBy July 1, 2028, suppliers must measure the total irrigated area of all CII landscapes with DIMs.\n\n### CII Classification Requirements\n\nSuppliers must classify CII customers into **22 categories** (18 from Energy Star plus 4 additional). Requirements include:\n- Converting large CII landscapes (using 500,000+ gallons per year) to dedicated irrigation meters by 2030\n- Implementing best management practices for top water users in each category\n- Providing water use data to certain large building owners\n\n## How Standards Work Together\n\nA supplier's total **Water Use Objective** = Indoor budget + Outdoor budget + Water loss allowance + CII budget + Special landscape areas + Approved variances.\n\nThe supplier can exceed any individual component as long as the **total** objective is met \u2014 except water loss, which must be met independently.\n\n## Variances\n\nSuppliers can request variances for unique water uses that materially affect their objective:\n- Evaporative coolers (common in hot inland areas)\n- Seasonal population fluctuations (tourist areas)\n- Recycled water irrigation with high total dissolved solids\n- Livestock, fire protection, soil compaction\n\nEach variance must represent at least **5% of the standard budget** and requires SWRCB approval.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe efficiency standards create a comprehensive, progressively tighter framework through 2040. Indoor use shrinks to 47+ GPCD, outdoor landscaping must match 55-80% of plant needs, system leaks face economic-model-based limits, and commercial landscapes get their own declining budget.\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Understand your supplier's water budget** \u2014 review the [CalWEP Conservation Framework overview](https://calwep.org/the-framework/) to see how indoor, outdoor, water loss, and CII standards combine into a single water use objective.\n2. **Check your landscape's efficiency** \u2014 use the [outdoor residential standard calculator](https://calwep.org/outdoor-residential-standard/) to estimate how your irrigation compares to the LEF-based budget.\n3. **Report water leaks** to your supplier \u2014 water loss standards at [SWRCB Water Loss Control](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/water_loss_control.html) require suppliers to track and reduce system leaks.\n4. **Ask about CII irrigation meters** if you manage commercial landscaping \u2014 large landscapes must convert to dedicated irrigation meters by 2030 under the [CII standards](https://calwep.org/commercial-industrial-institutional/).",

      "content": "# Urban Water Use Objectives: What Your Supplier Must Do\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nEvery major water supplier in California now has a custom water budget called an \"urban water use objective\" (UWUO). They must report against it annually and face penalties for not meeting it starting in 2027.\n\n## What Is a Water Use Objective?\n\nA UWUO is your water supplier's annual water budget \u2014 the total amount of water they're allowed to deliver across all categories. It's calculated by adding up standard-based budgets for:\n\n1. **Indoor residential use** (based on population x GPCD standard)\n2. **Outdoor residential use** (based on landscape area x local ET x efficiency factor)\n3. **Water loss allowance** (supplier-specific, based on economic model)\n4. **CII landscape irrigation** (commercial/industrial/institutional outdoor use)\n5. **Special landscape areas** (parks, medians, etc.)\n6. **Approved variances** (seasonal population, evaporative coolers, etc.)\n7. **Potable reuse bonus** (up to 15% credit for water recycling)\n\nEach supplier's UWUO is unique because it's based on their specific climate, geography, population, and infrastructure.\n\n## Who Is Covered?\n\nApproximately **405 urban retail water suppliers** \u2014 cities, water districts, and private companies \u2014 serving roughly **95% of California's population**.\n\nExempt: Irrigation-only suppliers, systems with fewer than 3,000 service connections, and suppliers delivering less than 3,000 acre-feet per year.\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n\n| What | When | Details |\n|------|------|---------|\n| Annual UWUO Report | Due January 1 each year | Machine-readable format, includes objective and actual use |\n| Certification Statement | With annual report | Mandatory signed certification |\n| Variance Requests | Due October 1 annually | Must meet 5% threshold, requires SWRCB approval |\n| Water Loss Leak Registry | Due January 1, 2029 | Covers breaks, repairs, and losses for 2025-2027 |\n\n## Enforcement: What Happens If a Supplier Misses Their Objective?\n\nThe [SWRCB](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html) uses a graduated enforcement approach:\n\n| Date | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| Starting Jan 2024 | **Informational orders** \u2014 SWRCB can ask for more data on why a supplier missed |\n| Starting Jan 2025 | **Written notices** \u2014 formal warning to address specific areas of concern |\n| Starting Jan 2026 | **Conservation orders** \u2014 supplier must take specific actions to improve |\n| After Nov 1, 2027 | **Monetary penalties** \u2014 $1,000/day (or $10,000/day during drought) |\n\nA supplier that misses its objective may be required to enact additional conservation policies and projects.\n\n## The Flexibility Rule\n\nSuppliers can exceed individual budgets (e.g., use more outdoor water than budgeted) as long as their **total UWUO is met**. The one exception: **water loss must be met independently** \u2014 you can't offset leaky pipes with indoor savings.\n\nThere's also a built-in safety valve: a supplier is **presumed compliant** if their 2040 water use doesn't exceed 70% of their 2026 water use.\n\n## The Potable Reuse Bonus\n\nSuppliers that invest in water recycling get a reward: they can increase their UWUO by up to:\n- **15%** for potable reuse water from existing facilities\n- **10%** for potable reuse water from new facilities\n\nThis incentivizes investment in recycled water infrastructure.\n\n## How to Find Your Supplier's Plan\n\n1. **[DWR UWMP Database](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Water-Use-And-Efficiency/Urban-Water-Use-Efficiency)**: The Department of Water Resources maintains a database of all Urban Water Management Plans at water.ca.gov\n2. **Your water utility's website**: Most post their UWMP and conservation plans online\n3. **SWRCB Water Use Explorer**: waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/water-use-explorer/ lets you search supplier data\n4. **Ask directly**: Call your water utility's customer service and request information about their conservation plan\n\n## What This Means for Ratepayers\n\n- Your supplier needs to reduce water use gradually through 2040\n- Rates will likely increase to cover compliance costs and offset revenue from selling less water\n- More rebates and conservation programs will be available\n- Budget-based or tiered rate structures may be implemented to encourage savings\n- The [Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO)](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4823) estimates the framework will save about 440,000 acre-feet annually \u2014 roughly 1% of total state water use\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nYour water supplier now has a permanent, annual water budget with real consequences for missing it. The budget is custom-built for their service area, and they have flexibility in how they meet it \u2014 but meet it they must, starting with reports in 2025 and penalties by 2027.\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Find your supplier's water use objective** \u2014 search the [DWR Urban Water Use Efficiency database](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Water-Use-And-Efficiency/Urban-Water-Use-Efficiency) for your water supplier's UWMP and conservation targets.\n2. **Review the LAO's analysis** of the framework's impact at the [Legislative Analyst's Office report](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4823) to understand projected rate impacts and water savings.\n3. **Check your supplier's compliance status** through the [SWRCB Conservation Portal](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html) \u2014 annual reports are public record.\n4. **Ask your supplier** about their water use objective, how close they are to meeting it, and what conservation programs are available to help you reduce use.",

      "content": "# Drought Restrictions vs. Permanent Conservation Rules\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nCalifornia has two separate systems: **temporary drought restrictions** (emergency, activated during declared droughts) and **permanent conservation standards** (apply all the time, regardless of drought). As of 2025, no statewide drought emergency regulations are in effect, but permanent efficiency standards are now law.\n\n## Emergency Drought Restrictions\n\n### What They Are\nDuring declared drought emergencies, the Governor and State Water Board can impose mandatory restrictions on water use. These are temporary measures designed for crisis response.\n\n### How They Work\n- The **Governor** declares a drought emergency\n- The **[State Water Resources Control Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/emergency_regulation.html)** adopts emergency regulations\n- Water suppliers receive **mandatory conservation targets** (e.g., the 25% cutback ordered by Governor Brown during the 2014-2016 drought)\n- Restrictions apply statewide or to specific regions\n- They expire when the emergency ends\n\n### Historical Examples\n\n| Period | Emergency Action |\n|--------|------------------|\n| 2014-2016 | Governor Brown ordered 25% mandatory cutback; SWRCB set supplier-specific targets |\n| 2021-2022 | Governor Newsom declared drought emergency; conservation targets reinstated |\n| Dec 21, 2023 | Last statewide emergency conservation regulation **expired** |\n| June 5, 2024 | CII decorative grass watering ban **expired** |\n\n### Current Status (as of 2025)\n**No statewide water conservation emergency regulations are in effect.** However, local water agencies may have their own restrictions \u2014 check with your supplier.\n\n## Permanent Conservation Standards\n\n### What They Are\nUnder [AB 1668/SB 606 (2018)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html) and the regulation adopted July 3, 2024, every urban water supplier in California now has permanent water use efficiency standards \u2014 not tied to any drought declaration.\n\n### Key Permanent Requirements\n- **Urban Water Use Objectives**: Custom water budgets for ~405 suppliers (effective January 1, 2025)\n- **Indoor standard**: 47 GPCD as of January 2025\n- **Outdoor standard**: Landscape Efficiency Factor of 0.80 (tightening to 0.55 by 2040)\n- **Water loss standards**: Supplier-specific leak reduction targets\n- **AB 1572** (signed October 2023): Permanently bans watering decorative (non-functional) grass at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties \u2014 phased in over time\n\n### Always-Apply Practices\nEven without a drought emergency, the State Water Board considers certain water uses \"[wasteful and unreasonable](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/regs/wasteful_water_uses.html)\" under California's Constitution (Article X, Section 2). Commonly cited wasteful practices include:\n\n- Washing sidewalks or driveways with potable water (use a broom)\n- Running a hose without a shutoff nozzle\n- Watering landscapes during or within 48 hours of measurable rainfall\n- Operating decorative fountains without recirculating pumps\n- Overwatering landscapes so water runs off onto pavement\n- Irrigating non-functional turf at commercial properties (permanent under AB 1572)\n\nLocal agencies may enforce these year-round regardless of drought status.\n\n## The Big Shift: Crisis to Permanence\n\n| Feature | Drought Restrictions | Permanent Standards |\n|---------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **Trigger** | Governor declares emergency | Apply automatically |\n| **Duration** | Temporary \u2014 expire when emergency ends | Ongoing through 2040+ |\n| **Targets** | % cutbacks from baseline | Custom water budgets |\n| **Focus** | Crisis response | Long-term efficiency |\n| **Penalties** | Fines during emergency only | $1,000-$10,000/day starting 2027 |\n| **Scope** | Everyone | ~405 urban water suppliers |\n\n## What Could Still Trigger Emergency Restrictions?\n\nEven with permanent standards in place, the Governor retains authority to:\n- Declare drought emergencies\n- Order additional mandatory cutbacks on top of permanent standards\n- Curtail water rights (junior rights first)\n- Direct state agencies to take emergency action\n\nThis means future severe droughts could bring back temporary restrictions layered on top of the permanent framework.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nCalifornia moved from \"conserve only when the Governor says so\" to \"conserve all the time, with extra measures during emergencies.\" The permanent standards under AB 1668/SB 606 are now the baseline, and drought declarations can add temporary restrictions on top.\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Check current drought status** for your area at the [SWRCB Emergency Conservation Regulation page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/emergency_regulation.html) \u2014 as of 2025, no statewide emergency is in effect, but local restrictions may apply.\n2. **Know the permanent rules** \u2014 review [wasteful and unreasonable water uses](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/regs/wasteful_water_uses.html) that apply year-round regardless of drought status.\n3. **Understand your supplier's obligations** under the [permanent conservation framework](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/conservation/regs/water_efficiency_legislation.html) \u2014 these standards apply rain or shine.\n4. **Report water waste** to your local water supplier or regional board \u2014 wasteful practices like hosing driveways or irrigating during rain are prohibited at all times.",

      "content": "# Conservation and Your Water Bill: What It Means for You\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nCalifornia's permanent conservation standards affect your water bill through how your utility sets rates, offers rebates, and calculates your household's water budget. Rates may go up, but rebates and incentives can help offset the cost \u2014 and using less water always saves money.\n\n## How Conservation Standards Affect Your Rates\n\n### Why Rates May Increase\nYour water supplier must meet efficiency targets that reduce the total water they sell. Less water sold means less revenue \u2014 but the cost of maintaining pipes, treatment plants, and staff doesn't shrink. To cover this gap, suppliers may need to raise rates.\n\nThe [Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO)](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4823) noted that \"to cover added costs and offset potential revenue reductions from selling less water, suppliers likely will have to increase customer rates\" \u2014 with disproportionate impacts possible for lower-income households.\n\n### Rate Structures You May See\n\n**Tiered Pricing (Most Common)**\nWater costs more the more you use:\n\n| Tier | Usage Level | Rate Example |\n|------|------------|-------------|\n| Tier 1 | Essential/baseline use | Lowest rate |\n| Tier 2 | Moderate use | Higher rate |\n| Tier 3+ | Excessive use | Highest rate |\n\nMost California utilities use some form of tiered pricing. The specific thresholds and rates vary by utility.\n\n**Budget-Based Rates**\nSome utilities calculate a personalized water budget for each household based on:\n- Number of people in the home\n- Lot size and landscape area\n- Local climate (evapotranspiration)\n- Time of year\n\nWater within your budget is priced normally; water above it costs progressively more.\n\n**Note on Proposition 218**: California law requires water rates to be proportional to the cost of providing service. Utilities can't use water rates as a \"tax\" or penalty \u2014 rates must reflect actual costs.\n\n## Penalties for Excessive Residential Use\n\nUnder **[SB 814](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB814)**, water utilities can penalize residential customers who use excessive amounts of water during drought:\n- Fines of up to **$500 per 748 gallons** (one hundred cubic feet) over the excessive use threshold per billing cycle\n- Utilities must establish a threshold for what counts as \"excessive\"\n- Written warnings are typically issued before fines\n- Fines appear on your water bill\n\nOutside of declared drought, individual penalties depend on your local utility's policies.\n\n## Available Rebates and Incentives\n\n### Indoor Rebates\n| Item | Typical Rebate | Annual Savings |\n|------|---------------|----------------|\n| High-efficiency toilet (1.28 GPF or less) | $75-200 per toilet | ~13,000 gallons |\n| High-efficiency washing machine (ENERGY STAR) | $50-200 | ~5,000 gallons |\n| WaterSense showerhead | Free or rebated | ~2,700 gallons |\n| Hot water recirculation system | Varies | ~8,000-12,000 gallons |\n\n### Outdoor Rebates\n| Item | Typical Rebate | Savings |\n|------|---------------|--------|\n| Turf removal/landscape transformation | $1-4 per sq ft | 50-75% of outdoor use |\n| Smart irrigation controller | $50-200 | 15-30% of outdoor use |\n| Drip irrigation conversion | Varies | 20-50% of outdoor use |\n| Rain sensor or soil moisture sensor | $25-75 | Prevents overwatering |\n\n### Where to Find Rebates\n1. **[SaveOurWater.com Rebate Finder](https://saveourwater.com)**: Enter your zip code for local programs\n2. **Your utility's website**: Most offer their own rebate programs\n3. **SoCalWaterSmart.com**: For Southern California residents\n4. **BayAreaWaterSupplyConservation.com**: For Bay Area residents\n5. **WaterSense label**: Look for this EPA label on fixtures and appliances\n\n## How to Track Your Water Use\n\n### Read Your Water Meter\n1. Find your meter (usually near the street, in a concrete box)\n2. Read the numbers (most meters read in cubic feet or gallons)\n3. Check the reading at the start and end of a period to calculate use\n4. Compare to your bill to verify accuracy\n\n### Monitor Your Bill\n- Most utilities show your usage trend over time\n- Compare to the same month in previous years (seasonality matters)\n- Many utilities offer online portals or apps for real-time tracking\n- Some offer alerts when usage exceeds a threshold\n\n## What to Do If You Get a Violation Notice\n\n1. **Read it carefully** \u2014 identify what you're being cited for\n2. **Check for leaks** \u2014 a running toilet can waste 200+ gallons per day without you knowing\n3. **Review your irrigation schedule** \u2014 overwatering is the most common violation\n4. **Contact your utility** \u2014 ask about the appeals process and available assistance\n5. **Request a water audit** \u2014 many utilities offer free home water audits\n6. **Fix the issue promptly** \u2014 first violations are usually warnings; repeated violations bring fines\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nConservation standards will likely nudge your water rates up over time, but rebates, incentives, and smarter water use can more than offset the cost. Start by checking SaveOurWater.com for rebates in your area, fix any leaks, and make sure your landscape isn't drinking more water than it needs.\n\n## Take Action\n\n1. **Find rebates now** \u2014 use the [SaveOurWater.com Rebate Finder](https://saveourwater.com) to see what incentives are available for efficient fixtures, smart controllers, and turf removal in your area.\n2. **Review the rate impact analysis** from the [Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4823) to understand how conservation standards may affect your water costs.\n3. **Fix leaks immediately** \u2014 a running toilet wastes 200+ gallons per day and is the single biggest source of preventable indoor water waste.\n4. **Contact your water supplier** to ask about budget-based rates, free water audits, and [SB 814](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB814) penalty thresholds in your area.",
