## The Three Bots

| **Knowledge** | 1,401 chunks · semantic chunking on H2 boundaries |
| **Coverage** | All 9 Regional Water Boards · permits · funding · compliance · consumer FAQ |
| **Quality** | 194 URLs verified · 88 duplicates removed · 25/25 adversarial queries passed |

### BizBot — Business Licensing Assistant

## How It Works

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture** — specialized agents handle different question types
2. **RAG Pipeline** — semantic chunking → OpenAI embeddings → pgvector similarity search → augmented generation
3. **Decision Trees** — structured flows for permits, licenses, and eligibility that don't need AI inference
4. **Adversarial Testing** — real questions from Reddit, forums, and public comments (not self-generated)
5. **Quality Gates** — MD5 deduplication, URL verification, similarity threshold tuning

## Additional Projects

### Government Automation Factory

A meta-project for scaffolding new bot or form projects. Includes templates, RAG pipeline scripts, n8n workflow templates, and deploy checklists.

Two tracks:
- **Bot Track** — chat pages deployed as routes in the vanderdev-website SPA
- **Form Track** — standalone Docker containers (like [ECOS](https://github.com/vanderoffice/Automation))

### Shared Resources

Cross-bot shared data including California locations (58 counties, 482 cities) with lookup utilities used by all three bots.
