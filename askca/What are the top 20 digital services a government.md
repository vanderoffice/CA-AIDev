# What are the top 20 digital services a government should provide to its citizens in 2025 (ideal state) and what should the experience be like for the user?

Based on my comprehensive research across digital government services worldwide, I'll now compile a detailed report on the top 20 digital services governments should provide in 2025 and the ideal user experience for each.

## Top 20 Digital Services Governments Should Provide to Citizens in 2025

### Core Identity \& Authentication Services

**1. Digital Identity and Single Sign-On**

Governments should provide a unified digital identity system that allows citizens to access all government services with a single, secure login. Estonia's e-ID system and Singapore's Singpass serve as global exemplars, with Singpass now used by over 97% of Singapore's population to access more than 700 services. The ideal experience enables citizens to authenticate using multiple factors including biometric verification (facial recognition, fingerprint), creating a seamless yet highly secure access point. Citizens should be able to manage their identity credentials, control what information they share, and receive real-time fraud alerts if suspicious activity is detected.[^1_1][^1_2]

**2. Mobile Driver's License and Credentials**

Digital credentials stored in mobile wallets represent the future of identity verification. California's DMV Wallet demonstrates this approach, allowing citizens to present their driver's license via smartphone with selective disclosure—sharing only necessary information like age verification without revealing birth date or address. The user experience should be touchless, supporting both QR code scanning and NFC transmission, with the ability to verify credentials offline. Integration with TSA PreCheck and other verification systems reduces wait times and enhances convenience while improving privacy protection through encryption.[^1_3][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6]

### Financial \& Tax Services

**3. Online Tax Filing and Payment**

Comprehensive digital tax services should enable citizens to file returns, make payments, and manage tax obligations entirely online. Estonia's e-Tax Board processes over 97% of tax declarations electronically, with most completed in three to five minutes. The optimal experience includes pre-populated forms using government-held data, real-time validation to catch errors before submission, multiple payment options (bank transfer, credit card, digital wallets), and the ability to schedule payments up to a year in advance. AI-powered assistance can simplify complex tax guidance, as demonstrated by HMRC's tool that improved accessibility across 900+ pages of tax documentation.[^1_7][^1_8][^1_9][^1_10]

**4. Business Registration and Licensing**

Digital business registration should streamline the process of starting and managing a business. Estonia's e-Business Register allows entrepreneurs to establish new businesses online in minutes using digital signatures, with real-time updates to official databases. The ideal system provides guided workflows that identify required permits based on business activities, integrated payment processing for fees and deposits, automatic status updates via email, and connections to other government systems for seamless data sharing. California's online registration system exemplifies this approach by automatically saving progress and providing 24/7 access with live assistance during business hours.[^1_11][^1_12][^1_7]

**5. Government Payment Portal**

A centralized payment system should allow citizens to pay any government fee, fine, or obligation through a single platform. The experience should support multiple payment methods including direct bank transfers, credit/debit cards, digital wallets (PayPal, Apple Pay), and even cash options through partner locations. Real-time confirmation, digital receipts, payment history tracking, and the ability to set up payment plans for eligible obligations enhance usability. Integration with other government systems ensures payments automatically update relevant records across departments.[^1_13][^1_14]

### Permits \& Licenses

**6. Building Permits and Inspections**

Digital permit services transform construction and renovation processes by enabling online applications, document submission, status tracking, and inspection scheduling. Sacramento's streamlined permitting allows licensed contractors to pull minor permits online and schedule inspections directly. The optimal experience includes document checklists, plan upload capabilities, real-time application status updates, mobile access for contractors in the field, automated inspection report delivery, and GIS integration to verify zoning and property information. AI can pre-review applications to identify potential issues before submission, reducing back-and-forth requisitions.[^1_15][^1_16]

**7. Professional and Business Licenses**

Occupational licensing should be available entirely online with automated renewal reminders. The system should guide applicants through requirements based on their profession, accept electronic payment of fees, provide digital license credentials that can be verified instantly by employers or clients, and support reciprocity agreements for license portability across jurisdictions. Integration with continuing education providers can automatically update license records when requirements are met.[^1_11]

### Property \& Land Services

**8. Property Records and Land Registry**

Digital property services should provide instant access to ownership records, title information, property boundaries, and transaction history. The UK's HM Land Registry is implementing a digital-first strategy to automate straightforward transactions like remortgaging by 2030 and deliver near-instant register updates using AI by 2035. The ideal experience features interactive geospatial maps overlaying ownership data with environmental information, zoning, rights of way, and infrastructure plans. Secure e-signatures and digital identity verification enable remote property transactions while reducing fraud. Real-time alerts notify property owners of any changes to their records, and API access allows conveyancers and lenders to integrate directly with the system.[^1_17][^1_18][^1_7]

### Health \& Social Services

**9. Digital Health Records and Patient Portal**

Citizens should access their complete health information through a secure online portal, including medical history, prescriptions, test results, immunization records, and appointment scheduling. Estonia's Patient Portal exemplifies comprehensive health service digitization. The optimal experience enables patients to share records across providers using modern digital identity, receive medication reminders, schedule telehealth appointments, and communicate securely with healthcare providers. Integration with wearable devices and health apps allows for continuous monitoring and early intervention. AI-powered tools can help patients understand complex medical information and make informed decisions about their care.[^1_19][^1_20]

**10. Social Benefits Application and Management**

Comprehensive benefits portals should consolidate applications for unemployment insurance, food assistance (SNAP/CalFresh), cash assistance, housing support, and healthcare coverage. California's BenefitsCal.com provides a single entry point for multiple programs. The ideal user experience features eligibility pre-screening that guides applicants to appropriate programs, document upload via mobile device, application status tracking, benefit amount calculators, automated renewal reminders, and integrated case management. AI chatbots can answer questions 24/7 and help users complete applications, while data integration across programs reduces redundant information requests and enables "no wrong door" access.[^1_21][^1_22][^1_23]

**11. Childcare and Education Services**

Digital platforms should enable parents to search for licensed childcare providers, apply for subsidized care, check waitlist status, and enroll children in public schools online. The experience should include quality ratings and reviews, cost comparators, location-based search with maps, online application submission with document upload, and real-time status updates. For school enrollment, systems should pre-populate information from existing government records, provide digital signatures for forms, and automatically transfer records between schools when families move. Special education services should be coordinated digitally with assessment scheduling and IEP management tools.[^1_24][^1_25]

### Employment Services

**12. Unemployment Benefits and Workforce Services**

Digital unemployment systems should enable citizens to file claims, certify for benefits, report work and wages, and access job training—all online. California's UI Online demonstrates comprehensive service delivery with automatic email reminders for bi-weekly certification, faster payment processing than paper submissions, and integrated job search tools. The optimal experience uses identity verification (via ID.me or Login.gov) to prevent fraud while enabling legitimate claimants fast access, provides mobile-optimized interfaces for on-the-go management, offers estimated benefit calculators, and integrates with job boards and training providers to support rapid reemployment.[^1_26][^1_27][^1_28]

### Legal \& Justice Services

**13. Court Services and Electronic Filing**

Digital court systems should enable electronic filing of legal documents, online case management, virtual hearings, and digital access to court records. The federal CM/ECF system and state implementations show the path forward. The ideal experience provides 24/7 filing with automatic timestamp validation (filings until midnight are considered timely), real-time case status updates, secure document exchange between parties, integrated payment for filing fees, and public access to non-confidential records through PACER-style systems. Virtual hearing capabilities with screen sharing and electronic evidence presentation expand access to justice, particularly for rural communities and those with mobility challenges.[^1_29][^1_30][^1_31]

### Public Safety \& Emergency Services

**14. Emergency Alerts and Disaster Notification**

Comprehensive alert systems should deliver real-time warnings about natural disasters, severe weather, public safety threats, and evacuation orders through multiple channels: Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), mobile apps, email, and text messages. Sacramento Alert and similar systems allow citizens to register their contact information and preferences for opt-in notifications beyond mandatory WEA messages. The optimal experience provides geographic precision so citizens only receive relevant alerts, supports multiple languages, includes actionable instructions with maps showing evacuation routes and shelter locations, and enables two-way communication so citizens can report incidents or confirm receipt. Integration with earthquake early warning systems (like California's MyShake) provides critical seconds of advance notice.[^1_32][^1_33][^1_34][^1_35]

**15. Public Safety Reporting and Non-Emergency Services**

Digital platforms should enable citizens to report non-emergency issues like potholes, graffiti, streetlight outages, abandoned vehicles, and quality-of-life concerns through web interfaces or mobile apps. AI chatbots like Mississippi's MISSI streamline the reporting process by directing citizens to the correct agencies, accepting incident details with photos and location data, and providing status updates. The ideal experience includes map-based reporting to pinpoint exact locations, automatic routing to the appropriate department, duplicate detection to avoid multiple reports of the same issue, and transparency through public dashboards showing all reported issues and resolution status.[^1_36][^1_37]

### Transportation Services

**16. Real-Time Transit Information**

Public transportation agencies should provide real-time arrival and departure information, service alerts, route planning, and mobile ticketing. San Francisco's NextMuni and similar systems using GTFS Realtime feeds demonstrate effective implementation. The ideal user experience delivers live vehicle locations and predictions accessible via mobile apps, website widgets, station displays, and SMS, with accuracy within 1-2 minutes. Multimodal trip planning integrates buses, trains, bikes, and rideshare options. Mobile payment and digital fare cards eliminate the need for physical tickets. Accessibility features include audio announcements, visual displays, and integration with navigation apps for vision-impaired users. Service alerts pushed to registered users' devices explain delays and suggest alternative routes.[^1_38][^1_39][^1_40][^1_41]

**17. Vehicle Registration and DMV Services**

Comprehensive DMV services should be available online including vehicle registration renewal, address changes, duplicate registration requests, and appointment scheduling for in-person services requiring physical presence. The ideal experience features automatic renewal reminders via email/SMS sent before expiration, one-click renewal for straightforward cases, secure payment processing, immediate digital confirmation with printable temporary documents, and physical documents mailed within days. Virtual queuing systems allow citizens to schedule appointments and check in remotely, reducing wait times. Integration with smog check databases and insurance verification systems streamlines compliance checks.[^1_29]

### Information \& Transparency Services

**18. Public Records Request Portal**

Digital public records systems should enable citizens to submit requests online, track fulfillment status, and receive responsive documents electronically. The ideal portal includes searchable databases of frequently requested records available for immediate download, guided request forms that help citizens narrow their requests to improve response time, automatic acknowledgment with case numbers, status dashboards showing processing progress, and secure delivery of records via encrypted download or email. AI-powered search and redaction tools help agencies respond faster while protecting privacy. Proactive disclosure—publishing commonly requested records online without requiring formal requests—increases transparency and reduces workload.[^1_42][^1_43][^1_44]

### Civic Engagement Services

**19. Appointment Scheduling for Government Services**

Unified appointment systems should enable citizens to schedule in-person or virtual appointments with any government office including DMV, social services, permit centers, marriage license offices, and municipal courts. The optimal experience provides 24/7 online booking through a branded self-service portal available in multiple languages, intelligent routing to match citizens with the appropriate staff based on needs and availability, automated reminders via email/SMS with rescheduling options, customizable intake forms to gather necessary information before appointments, and virtual meeting integration (Zoom, Teams) for remote consultations. Wait time reduction and citizen satisfaction metrics guide continuous improvement.[^1_45][^1_29]

**20. AI-Powered Government Assistant and Chatbot**

Conversational AI should serve as the first point of contact for citizen questions, available 24/7 across government websites, mobile apps, and social media. Mississippi's MISSI has received 14+ awards for helping residents renew licenses, schedule tests, find employment assistance, get tax refund information, and locate official contact details. The ideal chatbot experience uses natural language processing to understand questions in context, provides accurate answers with source citations, escalates complex issues to human staff seamlessly, offers multilingual support, learns from interactions to improve responses, and integrates with backend systems to process transactions like payments and form submissions. The IRS chatbot has handled over 13 million inquiries and processed \$151 million in self-service payments, demonstrating significant impact. Success metrics show average response times dropping from 90 minutes to under 2 minutes for routine questions.[^1_46][^1_47][^1_36]

## The Ideal User Experience: Key Principles

Based on global best practices, the ideal digital government service experience in 2025 should embody these principles:

**Mobile-First and Omnichannel**: Services must work seamlessly across smartphones, tablets, and desktops with responsive design, supporting both self-service and assisted channels (phone, in-person) for digital equity.[^1_48][^1_49][^1_50]

**Accessible and Inclusive**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensures services work with screen readers and assistive technologies. Multilingual support, plain language, adjustable interfaces, and multiple authentication options serve diverse populations.[^1_51][^1_52]

**Fast and Efficient**: Citizens expect government services as easy as online shopping. Load times under 2 seconds, single-session transaction completion, pre-populated forms using existing government data, and automated processing where possible reduce friction.[^1_53][^1_54]

**Secure and Privacy-Enhancing**: Multi-factor authentication, end-to-end encryption, selective disclosure (sharing only required information), and transparent data policies build trust. Blockchain-based credentials provide tamper-proof verification while giving users control over their data.[^1_55][^1_2]

**Personalized**: Services should recognize returning users, remember preferences, provide proactive notifications about relevant deadlines or benefits, and offer customized dashboards showing an individual's complete government relationship.[^1_56][^1_13]

**Transparent**: Real-time status tracking for applications, clear timelines, automated updates, and public dashboards showing service performance build confidence. Citizens should always know where they stand in any process.[^1_57][^1_58]

**AI-Enhanced but Human-Centered**: Artificial intelligence should augment—not replace—human service delivery. AI streamlines workflows, provides instant answers to routine questions, and personalizes experiences, but complex cases requiring judgment should always have human escalation pathways.[^1_59][^1_13][^1_56]

**Integrated Across Government**: Citizens shouldn't need to understand bureaucratic structures. Services should share data appropriately across departments with citizen consent, eliminating redundant information requests and creating a unified government experience through single sign-on and linked services.[^1_60][^1_61][^1_62]

**Continuously Improving**: Analytics, user feedback, and usability testing should drive iterative improvements. A/B testing, journey mapping, and service design thinking ensure services evolve to meet changing citizen needs.[^1_48][^1_57]

Governments that successfully implement these 20 digital services with citizen-centric design will deliver faster, more transparent, and more accessible public services while building trust and demonstrating that government can match—or exceed—private sector digital experiences. The transformation requires strong leadership, adequate funding, digital skills development for the public workforce, and most importantly, a commitment to designing services around real human needs rather than internal government processes.[^1_54][^1_62][^1_55][^1_56]

# What are the top 20 life events that a person might experience (e.g. finding a job, having a child, loosing a loved one, etc) that the government could support with better digital services? Which services for which event?

Now I have comprehensive information about life events that governments support. Let me compile this into a detailed report on the top 20 life events and the digital services that should support them.

## Top 20 Life Events and Supporting Digital Services

Governments worldwide are increasingly organizing services around major life events—significant moments that require citizens to interact with multiple government agencies. Based on comprehensive research into global best practices, federal initiatives, and citizen-centric service design frameworks, here are the 20 most critical life events governments should support with integrated digital services, along with the specific services needed for each.

### 1. Having a Child (Birth)

**Life Event Significance:** One of the most common and complex life events, affecting approximately 3.9 million families annually in the U.S. alone. Parents need to coordinate services across health, social services, education, and financial assistance agencies.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3]

**Digital Services Needed:**

- **Birth registration and certificate issuance** with instant digital copies and mobile wallet credentials[^2_4][^2_5]
- **Automatic enrollment in health insurance** including Medicaid/CHIP and employer plan updates[^2_6]
- **Social Security number application** integrated with birth registration[^2_1]
- **Financial benefits enrollment** including baby bonuses, child tax credits, and family allowances[^2_7]
- **Maternity/paternity leave processing** for employed parents[^2_8]
- **WIC and nutrition assistance** application with automatic eligibility screening[^2_9]
- **Childcare subsidy applications** with provider search and waitlist management[^2_10][^2_11][^2_12]
- **Pediatric care provider search** and appointment scheduling[^2_13]

## Key Principles for Life Event Service Design

Based on research into Estonia, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and emerging U.S. federal initiatives, the optimal life event service experience embodies:[^2_2][^2_107][^2_3][^2_1][^2_7]

**Anticipatory Service:** Proactively offer services citizens may not know they're eligible for based on life event triggers.[^2_2][^2_3][^2_7]

**"Tell Us Once" Data Sharing:** Single notification cascades to all relevant agencies with citizen consent, eliminating repetitive form-filling.[^2_1][^2_7]

**Integrated Service Baskets:** Bundle all related services for a life event into unified offerings rather than separate agency transactions.[^2_2][^2_1][^2_7]

**Journey Advisory Boards:** NSW Australia's model assigns cross-agency governance teams as custodians for each life event journey, ensuring citizen-centric outcomes.[^2_7]

**Proactive Funding Models:** Dedicated funds like NSW's \$2.1B Digital Restart Fund and New Zealand's Better Public Services Seed Fund enable cross-agency collaboration.[^2_7]

**Federated Data Exchanges:** Estonia and New Zealand's models allow agencies to query each other's data without centralized storage, preserving security while enabling integration.[^2_7]

**Life Event Maturity Progression:** Governments should advance from Level 1 (department-centric, siloed services) through Level 2 (informational portals) and Level 3 (partially integrated) toward Level 4 (fully integrated with automated workflows and "once-only" data entry).[^2_7]

**Human-Centered Design:** Ethnographic research, journey mapping, and continuous user testing ensure services address actual pain points rather than governmental assumptions.[^2_7]

**Trust Through Transparency:** Citizens must see which agencies access their data and understand security measures—Estonia allows citizens to challenge any data access.[^2_7]

Governments that successfully implement life event-based digital services will transform the citizen experience from navigating bureaucratic mazes to receiving coordinated, compassionate support during life's most significant moments. As the federal government pursues its five priority life experiences, states and localities should catalog their own life events, establish governance mechanisms, secure funding, and begin the journey toward truly citizen-centric service delivery.[^2_36][^2_2][^2_1][^2_7]
