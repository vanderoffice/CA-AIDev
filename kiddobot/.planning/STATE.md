## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| — | Production-first doctrine | Dev repo divergence cost WaterBot a full reconciliation phase |
| — | Skip Phase 2 | WaterBot already built shared components |
| — | Data-driven thresholds | Hardcoded SMI/FPL values break every fiscal year |
| 1 | Keep 403 URLs as-is | Government sites block bots but work in browsers — verified via GET |
| 1 | Audit over-counted broken URLs | HEAD-only testing produced false positives; actual broken count ~18 not 48 |
