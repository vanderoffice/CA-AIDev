# Childcare for Families Experiencing Homelessness

**Purpose:** Special protections and resources for homeless families accessing childcare in California.

---

## Key Message

**You have rights.** Federal law (McKinney-Vento Act) protects your family's access to education and childcare, even without a permanent address or traditional documentation.

---

## McKinney-Vento Act Protections

### What It Is

The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act is federal law that:
- Ensures educational rights for homeless children and youth
- Requires immediate enrollment in school and preschool
- Removes documentation barriers
- Provides support services

### Who It Covers

Children and youth living in:
- Shelters (emergency or transitional)
- Hotels or motels (due to lack of housing)
- Cars, parks, campgrounds, or public spaces
- Shared housing with others ("doubled up") due to hardship
- Transitional housing programs
- Abandoned buildings
- Substandard housing (no utilities, no running water)

**Also covered:**
- Unaccompanied youth (homeless on their own)
- Migrant children meeting the definition above

**Not covered:**
- Families sharing housing by choice (not economic necessity)
- Permanent shared housing arrangements
