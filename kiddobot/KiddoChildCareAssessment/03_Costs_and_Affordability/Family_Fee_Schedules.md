# Family Fees for Subsidized Childcare

**Purpose:** Understand what you'll pay if you receive subsidized childcare in California.

---

## Key Concept: Subsidized ≠ Free

If you qualify for subsidized childcare, the state pays most of the cost — but you may pay a **family fee** depending on your income.

```
Total Childcare Cost = State Subsidy + Family Fee
```

## Who Pays Family Fees?

### Fee Exemption (No Family Fee)

You pay **NO family fee** if:

## How Family Fees Are Calculated

### The Formula

Family fees are based on:
1. **Adjusted monthly income** (after deductions)
2. **Family size**
3. **Full-time vs. part-time care**

### Maximum Fee Caps

| Program | Maximum Family Fee |
|---------|-------------------|
| **CSPP (State Preschool)** | 1% of monthly income |
| **CCDF/CDSS Programs** | ~10% of income |

### Example Calculations

**Family of 4, Monthly Income $8,500 (between 75-85% SMI)**

| Program | Calculation | Monthly Fee |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| CSPP | 1% × $8,500 | $85/month |
| CCDF | Based on fee schedule | ~$100–200/month |

*Actual fees vary based on specific program and county.*

| $8,500 | $85.00 |

## What Counts as Income?

### Counted Income

| Source | Counted? |
|--------|----------|
| Wages and salary | Yes |
| Self-employment income | Yes (net, after expenses) |
| Tips and commissions | Yes |
| Child support received | Yes |
| Alimony received | Yes |
| Unemployment benefits | Yes |
| Social Security | Yes |
| Disability payments | Yes |
| Rental income | Yes |

### NOT Counted

| Source | Counted? |
|--------|----------|
| CalWORKs cash aid | No |
| SSI (Supplemental Security Income) | No |
| Food stamps (CalFresh/SNAP) | No |
| Housing assistance | No |
| One-time payments (tax refunds, windfalls) | Usually no |
| Student loans | No |
| Child support you PAY | Deductible |

---

## Deductions from Income

### Standard Deductions

When calculating adjusted monthly income, these may be deducted:

| Deduction | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Child support paid | Actual amount paid |
| Health insurance premiums | Actual amount paid |
| Catastrophic expenses | Case-by-case |

### How Deductions Lower Your Fee

**Example:**
- Gross income: $8,500/month
- Child support paid: -$500/month
- Adjusted income: $8,000/month
- Lower adjusted income = potentially lower fee or exemption

---

## Multiple Children & One Fee

### The Rule

If you have multiple children enrolled in subsidized care, you pay **one flat monthly fee** based on the child with the greatest certified care hours.

### Example

| Child | Program | Monthly Hours |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Child 1 | CSPP | 80 hours |
| Child 2 | After-school | 60 hours |

**Result:** You pay the full-time fee based on Child 1 (80 hours) — NOT separate fees for each child.

---

## When Fees Are Assessed

### Initial Certification

- Fee calculated at enrollment
- Based on current income and family size
- Documented with pay stubs, employer letter, etc.

### Recertification (Every 24 Months)

- Fee recalculated
- Updated income documentation required
- Fee may increase or decrease based on income changes

### Reporting Changes

| Change | Must Report? |
|--------|--------------|
| Income exceeds 85% SMI | Yes — immediately |
| Minor income increase (still under 85%) | No (stable within eligibility) |
| Address change | Yes (for records) |
| Family size change | Yes (affects thresholds) |
| Loss of job | Yes (may change need determination) |

## How to Pay Family Fees

### Payment Methods

| Method | Typical Options |
|--------|-----------------|
| Automatic bank draft | Most APPs offer this |
| Check | By due date (usually monthly) |
| Money order | Accepted |
| Credit card | Some programs accept |
| Payroll deduction | If employer arranges |

### Due Dates

- Usually monthly (1st of month or upon billing)
- Check your contract for specific due date
- Late fees may apply for overdue payments

### What If You Can't Pay?

Contact your APP immediately if you're struggling:
- Payment plans may be available
- Exemption based on hardship may apply
- Better to communicate than miss payments

## Fee vs. Provider Cost

### Understanding the Math

| Component | Who Pays |
|-----------|----------|
| **Family fee** | You pay directly to APP or provider |
| **State subsidy** | Paid directly to provider by state |
| **Total provider payment** | Fee + Subsidy = RMR ceiling (max) |

### Example

| | Amount |
|-|--------|
| Provider's rate | $1,500/month |
| RMR ceiling | $1,400/month |
| State subsidy | $1,300/month |
| Your family fee | $100/month |
| Provider receives | $1,400/month |

**Note:** If provider charges more than RMR, they cannot charge you the difference (for subsidized care).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: My income went up slightly. Will my fee change immediately?

**A:** No. Fees are set at certification and recertification (every 24 months). Your fee stays stable unless your income exceeds 85% SMI (loss of eligibility) or you request a fee recalculation.

### Q: Can I ask for my fee to be recalculated if my income drops?

**A:** Yes. Contact your APP if you experience a significant income decrease. They can recalculate your fee before regular recertification.

### Q: Do I pay fees during my child's vacation or sick days?

**A:** Generally yes. Your fee is based on certified need, not actual attendance. You pay the monthly fee regardless of absences.

### Q: What if I have two children in different subsidized programs?

**A:** You pay one fee based on the child with the most certified hours. You don't pay separate fees for each child.

### Q: Can my fee ever be zero even if I'm above 75% SMI?

**A:** Possibly. If you qualify for an exemption (CPS, homeless, catastrophic circumstances), you may have $0 fee even with higher income.
