# Work and Activity Requirements for Childcare Subsidies

**Purpose:** Understand what qualifies as an eligible "need" for subsidized childcare in California.

---

## The Core Principle

Subsidized childcare requires a documented **need** — you must demonstrate why you cannot care for your child yourself during the hours you're requesting childcare.

```
Eligible Need Categories:
├── Employment
├── Self-Employment
├── Seeking Employment (job searching)
├── Vocational Training / Education
├── Incapacity (medical)
├── Seeking Permanent Housing
└── Child Protective Services (CPS)
```

## Employment

### Who Qualifies

Any parent who is:
- Working for an employer (W-2)
- Self-employed
- Working as an independent contractor
- Working in gig economy jobs

### Documentation Required

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Pay stubs** | Last 30-60 days |
| **Employer letter** | Job title, schedule, pay |
| **Release authorization** | Permission to verify employment |

The employer letter must include:
- Your name and position
- Days and hours you work
- Start date of employment
- Pay rate
- Employer contact information

### Hours Authorized

Childcare hours are based on your actual work schedule:

```
Work hours: 8am - 5pm (9 hours)
Commute: 30 min each way (1 hour)
Authorized childcare: 10 hours/day
```

**Travel time is included** — agencies add reasonable commute time to your work hours.

### Variable/Unpredictable Schedules

If your hours change week to week:
1. Agency looks at your week with the **most hours** in the past 4 weeks
2. Authorizes childcare for that maximum
3. Reviews every 4 months until schedule stabilizes

**Example:**
```
Week 1: 25 hours
Week 2: 35 hours
Week 3: 40 hours ← Maximum
Week 4: 30 hours

Authorized: Up to 40 hours/week childcare
```

## Self-Employment

### Special Requirements

Self-employed parents face additional scrutiny because they have more control over their schedules.

**If you work from home**, you must justify why you can't supervise your child while working. Consider:
- Nature of work (client calls, meetings, concentration needed)
- Child's age and needs
- Safety considerations
- Professional requirements

### Documentation Required

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Tax return** | Most recent year's Schedule C |
| **Profit & Loss** | Current year statement |
| **Business records** | Receipts, invoices, logs |
| **Business license** | If applicable |
| **Client list** | With contact information |
| **Appointment logs** | Showing work schedule |

### How Hours Are Determined

Agency assesses "reasonableness" based on:
- Your industry and typical hours
- Your declared income and hourly rate
- Business records showing activity
- Community standards for similar work

**Example:**
```
Self-employed house cleaner:
- 4 regular clients, 4 hours each
- Travel time between jobs
- Administrative time (scheduling, supplies)

Reasonable authorization: 20-25 hours/week
```

### Working from Home

If you work from home, you must explain:
1. **Type of work** — What do you do?
2. **Requirements** — Why can't you supervise?
3. **Child's age** — Younger children need more care
4. **Specific needs** — If child is 5+, what specific needs require care?

**Acceptable justifications:**
- Work requires concentration (writing, programming)
- Work involves client calls/meetings
- Work involves hazardous materials or equipment
- Child has special needs requiring attention

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I'm between jobs?

**A:** Apply for seeking employment childcare. You have 60 days to find work (extendable to 80). Use this time to job search actively.

### Q: Can I get childcare if I'm a stay-at-home parent?

**A:** Only if you have another qualifying need:
- Enrolled in training program
- Seeking employment
- Have documented incapacity
- Child receiving CPS services

Being a stay-at-home parent alone doesn't qualify.

### Q: What if my schedule changes frequently?

**A:** Your authorization can be for a "variable schedule" based on your maximum hours. Update your APP if patterns change significantly.

### Q: Do both parents need to have a qualifying need?

**A:** In a two-parent household, both parents generally need a qualifying need during the hours childcare is requested, OR one parent must be unavailable (at work, school, etc.) during those hours.

### Q: What counts as "reasonable" commute time?

**A:** Usually:
- 30-60 minutes each way for local commutes
- Longer for documented long-distance commutes
- Based on actual distance and traffic patterns
