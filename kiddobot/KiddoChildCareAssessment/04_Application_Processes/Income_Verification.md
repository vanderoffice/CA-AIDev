# Income Verification for Childcare Subsidies

**Purpose:** Understand how California childcare agencies verify your income and what documentation you need.

---

## The Basic Rule

California uses **income from the previous 30 days** as the basis for determining eligibility.

```
Income received in the 30 days before application
           ↓
Used to project income for the certification period
           ↓
Determines eligibility and family fee level
```

---

## Income Thresholds (2025-26)

| Family Size | 75% SMI (Fee Exempt) | 85% SMI (CCDF Eligible) | 100% SMI (CSPP Eligible) |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1-2 | $6,053/mo | $6,860/mo | $8,071/mo |
| 3 | $6,869/mo | $7,785/mo | $9,159/mo |
| 4 | $7,959/mo | $9,020/mo | $10,612/mo |
| 5 | $9,232/mo | $10,463/mo | $12,310/mo |
| 6 | $10,505/mo | $11,906/mo | $14,007/mo |

**What these mean:**
- Below 75% SMI → No family fee
- Below 85% SMI → Eligible for CCDF/APP subsidies
- Below 100% SMI → Eligible for California State Preschool

## Verification by Employment Type

### Traditional W-2 Employment

**What you need:**
1. Pay stubs for the last 30-60 days (all pay periods)
2. Employer verification letter

**Employer letter must include:**
- Your name and position
- Date employment started
- Days and hours you work
- Hourly wage or salary
- Employer name, address, phone

**What the agency does:**
- Calculates monthly income from pay stubs
- May contact employer to verify (with your permission)
- Reviews for consistency with stated hours

**Example:**
```
Maria brings 4 bi-weekly pay stubs:
- Stub 1: $1,200 gross
- Stub 2: $1,150 gross
- Stub 3: $1,200 gross
- Stub 4: $1,180 gross

Total for 2 months: $4,730
Monthly average: $2,365
Annual projection: $28,380

Maria's family of 3: Well below 85% SMI ($7,785/mo)
Result: ELIGIBLE
```

---

### Self-Employment / Independent Contractors

**What you need:**
1. Most recent signed tax return (with all schedules)
2. Current year profit & loss statement
3. Business records (receipts, invoices, ledgers)
4. Business license (if applicable)

**How income is calculated:**

```
Gross business income
  - Business expenses
  - Depreciation
  = Net self-employment income
```

**Key considerations:**
- Agencies typically average income over 12 months
- Seasonal businesses: Explain your patterns
- New businesses: Provide available records + projection
- Home-based work: May need to justify childcare need

**Example:**
```
Juan is a freelance graphic designer:
- Last year's Schedule C shows $42,000 net profit
- Monthly average: $3,500

Juan's family of 4: Below 85% SMI ($9,020/mo)
Result: ELIGIBLE
```

**Documentation alternatives if tax return not available:**
- Bank statements showing deposits
- Client invoices/contracts
- Appointment or job logs
- Mileage records
- Client list with contact info

---

### Gig Economy Workers (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, etc.)

**What you need:**
1. Earnings statements from app(s)
2. Bank statements showing deposits
3. Self-certification of income
4. Mileage/expense records

**Challenges:**
- Income varies week to week
- Multiple platforms may be used
- Expenses can be significant

**How agencies handle variable income:**
```
Option 1: Average previous 12 months (if available)
Option 2: Average previous 30 days
Option 3: Self-certification with supporting docs
```

**Tips for gig workers:**
- Download earnings summaries from each app
- Screenshot weekly earnings breakdowns
- Keep expense receipts for deductions
- Track mileage for self-employment deduction

---

### Tips and Cash Income

**What you need:**
1. Employer letter (stating base wages)
2. Tip records (if employer tracks)
3. Self-certification of tip income
4. Bank statements (showing deposits)

**The challenge:** Tips often aren't fully documented.

**How to handle it:**
- Estimate average tips honestly
- Sign self-certification under penalty of perjury
- Provide supporting evidence (bank deposits)
- Agency assesses reasonableness

**Example:**
```
Server at restaurant:
- Base wage: $15.50/hr × 30 hrs/wk = $1,860/mo
- Estimated tips: $800/mo
- Total monthly income: $2,660

Family of 2: Below 85% SMI ($6,860/mo)
Result: ELIGIBLE
```

---

### Variable/Unpredictable Hours

**What you need:**
1. Pay stubs showing variation
2. Employer letter confirming variable schedule
3. Statement of maximum hours worked

**How agencies calculate:**
- Look at the week with the **most hours** in the past 4 weeks
- Authorize childcare for that maximum
- Require update every 4 months until schedule stabilizes

**Example:**
```
Retail worker with variable schedule:
- Week 1: 32 hours
- Week 2: 20 hours
- Week 3: 38 hours ← Maximum
- Week 4: 25 hours

Authorized childcare: Based on 38-hour week
Schedule: Variable, up to 38 hours/week
```

---

### Zero Income / Unemployed

**What you need:**
- Signed declaration stating zero income
- May need bank statements to verify

**The rule:**
> "Zero income stated on the application is sufficient verification that the household cannot reasonably anticipate income during the certification period."

**You don't need to prove a negative.** Simply declare zero income, and unless the agency has a specific reason to question it, this is accepted.

**If recently unemployed:**
- Provide termination letter or last pay stub
- Unemployment claim documentation
- Declaration that no other income exists

---

### Multiple Income Sources

**What you need:**
- Documentation for EACH income source
- Summary of all sources

**How it's calculated:**

| Source | Monthly Amount |
|--------|---------------|
| Primary job | $2,400 |
| Part-time job | $600 |
| Child support | $400 |
| **Total** | **$3,400** |

All sources are added together for total household income.

## Household Income: Who's Counted?

### Always Counted

| Person | Income Counted? |
|--------|----------------|
| You (applicant) | ✅ Yes |
| Your spouse | ✅ Yes |
| Your children's other parent (if in home) | ✅ Yes |

### Sometimes Counted

| Person | Income Counted? |
|--------|----------------|
| Unmarried partner living with you | ✅ Usually yes |
| Adult children (18+) in household | Depends on situation |
| Grandparents | Only if legal guardian |

### Not Counted

| Person | Income Counted? |
|--------|----------------|
| Roommates (not in relationship) | ❌ No |
| Other household members not parents | ❌ No |
| Non-custodial parent | ❌ No |

**Key rule:** If an unmarried partner lives with you, their income generally counts as part of household income, even if they're not the child's parent.

---

## Income Changes After Certification

### What You Must Report

| Change | Must Report? | When |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Income exceeds 85% SMI | ✅ Yes | Immediately |
| Job loss | ✅ Yes | Within 5 days |
| New job (but still under 85%) | ❌ No | Not required |
| Small raise | ❌ No | Not required |
| Address change | ✅ Yes | Within 5 days |

### 24-Month Stability Period

Once certified, your eligibility is stable for 24 months:
- Minor income changes don't affect eligibility
- Only report if income exceeds 85% SMI
- Recertification happens at 24 months

**Example:**
```
Certified at $6,500/month for family of 4
Month 8: Get raise to $7,200/month
85% SMI for family of 4: $9,020/month

Still under threshold → No reporting required
Continue receiving subsidy
```

## When Income Changes Are Advantageous to Report

### If your income DROPS significantly

**You can request recalculation** to:
- Lower your family fee
- Qualify for fee exemption (below 75% SMI)

Contact your APP and provide:
- Documentation of income change
- Request for fee recalculation

---

## Special Situations

### Recently Separated/Divorced

If you recently separated and the other parent's income was counted:
- Provide documentation of separation
- Only YOUR income counts now
- May need legal documentation or declaration

### Child Support Changes

If child support amount changes:
- New court order showing new amount
- Documentation of actual payments received
- Self-certification if payments stopped

### Newly Self-Employed

If starting a business without tax history:
- Business plan with income projections
- Business license/registration
- Initial client contracts
- Bank statements showing deposits

---

## Deductions That Lower Countable Income

### Standard Deductions

| Deduction | Allowed? |
|-----------|----------|
| Child support you PAY | ✅ Yes |
| Court-ordered payments | ✅ Yes |
| Health insurance premiums | ✅ Yes (varies) |

### How Deductions Work

```
Gross monthly income: $8,500
Child support paid: -$500
Adjusted income: $8,000

Lower adjusted income = possibly lower fee or exemption
```

## Common Verification Problems

### Problem: Employer won't respond to verification requests

**Solution:** Sign a release, provide employer contact info, and give the agency time. If employer still doesn't respond, your documentation (pay stubs) may be accepted alone.

### Problem: Income varies too much to calculate

**Solution:** Agency will use:
1. Average of last 12 months (preferred)
2. Average of last 30 days
3. Your estimate with supporting documentation

### Problem: Part of income is cash/under the table

**Solution:** Declare ALL income including cash. Sign self-certification under penalty of perjury. Undeclared income can result in fraud charges if discovered.

### Problem: Self-employed spouse doesn't file taxes

**Solution:** Provide whatever business records exist. May need to file taxes to establish income. Consider consulting with a tax preparer.
