├─ YES → CalWORKs Stage 1 (through your county)
│
└─ NO → Did you receive CalWORKs in the last 24 months?
        │
        ├─ YES → CalWORKs Stage 2 or 3 (through APP)
        │
        └─ NO → Is your income ≤ 85% SMI?
                │
                ├─ YES → CCDF voucher subsidies (through APP)
                │
                └─ NO → Not subsidy-eligible
                        (Consider TK, employer FSA, tax credits)

| **Administered by** | Alternative Payment Programs (APPs) |
| **Entitlement?** | No — subject to funding and waitlists |

| **Family fees** | Sliding scale; exempt if below 75% SMI |
| **Duration** | 24-month eligibility periods |
| **Work requirement** | Must have documented need (work, school, seeking work) |

## Income Thresholds Compared

### CalWORKs Cash Aid Eligibility (MBSAC)

To receive CalWORKs cash aid, gross income must be below:

| Family Size | Monthly MBSAC |
|-------------|---------------|
| 2 | $1,401 |
| 3 | $1,736 |
| 4 | $2,063 |
| 5 | $2,350 |

*Very low threshold — designed for families in poverty*

### CCDF / CalWORKs Stage 3 Eligibility (85% SMI)

| Family Size | Monthly 85% SMI |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 3 | $7,785 |
| 4 | $9,020 |
| 5 | $10,463 |
| 6 | $11,906 |

*Much higher threshold — serves working families up to moderate income*

### CA State Preschool (100% SMI)

| Family Size | Monthly 100% SMI |
|-------------|------------------|
| 3 | $9,159 |
| 4 | $10,612 |
| 5 | $12,310 |

*Highest threshold — broader access to preschool*

## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Welfare Connection

**CalWORKs Child Care:** You must be receiving (or have recently received) CalWORKs cash assistance. The childcare is tied to your participation in the welfare-to-work system.

**CCDF Subsidies:** No welfare connection required. You qualify based on income and work status alone.

### 2. Entitlement vs. Funding-Dependent

**CalWORKs Stages 1 & 2:** These are *entitlements*. If you meet the criteria, you are guaranteed services. No waitlist (though processing takes time).

**CCDF Vouchers & Stage 3:** These are *funding-dependent*. Even if you're eligible, you may be placed on a waitlist until a slot opens.

### 3. Family Fees

**CalWORKs Stage 1:** No fees while receiving cash aid.

**CalWORKs Stage 2/3 and CCDF:** Fees on a sliding scale based on income. Families below 75% SMI are exempt.

### 4. The 60-Month Limit Myth

CalWORKs cash aid has a 60-month (5-year) lifetime limit. However, **child care is NOT subject to this limit**. You can continue receiving CalWORKs child care through Stages 2 and 3 even after exhausting your 60 months of cash aid.
