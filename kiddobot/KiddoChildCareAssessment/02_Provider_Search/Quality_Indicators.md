# How to Evaluate Childcare Quality

**Purpose:** Understand what makes quality childcare and how to assess it.

---

## Why Quality Matters

Research consistently shows that high-quality early care:
- Improves school readiness
- Supports social-emotional development
- Reduces need for later remedial services
- Has lasting effects into adulthood

**Quality isn't just about safety** — it's about whether the environment actively supports your child's development.

## The Three Pillars of Quality

Quality childcare includes:

| Pillar | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Health & Safety** | Physical safety, supervision, cleanliness |
| **Developmental Environment** | Activities, interactions, learning opportunities |
| **Staff Quality** | Training, stability, responsiveness |

---

## Staff-to-Child Ratios

### Why Ratios Matter

Lower ratios mean:
- More individual attention for each child
- Better supervision and safety
- More responsive interactions
- More learning opportunities

### California Requirements by Age

| Age Group | Title 22 (Minimum) | Title 5 (Subsidized) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Infants (0-18 mo)** | 1:4 | 1:3 |
| **Toddlers (18-36 mo)** | 1:6 | 1:4 |
| **Preschool (3-5 yrs)** | 1:12 | 1:8 |
| **School-age (K+)** | 1:14 | 1:14 |

### Family Child Care Ratios

| Home Type | Capacity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Small FCCH** | Up to 8 children (1 provider) |
| **Large FCCH** | 9-14 children (provider + assistant) |

**Note:** Provider's own children under 10 count in the ratio.

### What to Look For

```
When you visit:
□ Count adults and children in each group
□ Are ratios being maintained?
□ Is there backup when staff take breaks?
□ What happens during transitions (meals, naps)?
```

## Teacher Qualifications

### California Requirements

| **Associate Teacher** | 6 ECE units | 12 ECE units |
| **Aide** | No units required | No units required |
| **Director** | Varies by program size | Higher requirements |

### Understanding Credentials

California issues Child Development Permits through the Commission on Teacher Credentialing:

| Permit Level | Requirements | Can Do |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Assistant** | 6 ECE units | Work under supervision |
| **Associate** | 12 ECE units + 50 days experience | Work with less supervision |
| **Teacher** | 24 ECE + 16 GE units + experience | Lead a classroom |
| **Master Teacher** | Bachelor's degree + experience | Lead, mentor, coordinate |
| **Site Supervisor** | Higher units + admin coursework | Supervise programs |
| **Program Director** | Bachelor's or higher + extensive experience | Direct multiple sites |

### Beyond Minimum Requirements

Some indicators of higher quality:
- Teachers with Bachelor's degrees in ECE
- National credentials (CDA, NAEYC certifications)
- Ongoing professional development
- Low staff turnover
- Staff who stay with the same children over time

### Questions to Ask

```
□ What education/training do your teachers have?

□ What ongoing training do staff receive?
□ How long have your teachers worked here?
□ What is your staff turnover rate?
```

## Quality Counts California

### What It Is

California's statewide Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). Participating programs are rated on quality indicators.

### How It Works

- Programs undergo assessment
- Receive ratings on quality areas
- Get support for improvement
- Ratings help families make informed choices

### What Quality Counts Assesses

| Quality Area | What's Measured |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Child Development** | Curriculum, learning activities, readiness |
| **Teachers & Teaching** | Qualifications, interactions, CLASS scores |
| **Program & Environment** | Health, safety, learning environment |

### How to Use Quality Counts

1. Visit [qualitycountsca.net](https://qualitycountsca.net)
2. Search for programs in your area
3. Review ratings and quality information
4. Use as one factor in your decision

**Note:** Not all programs participate. Non-participation doesn't mean low quality.

## Classroom Interactions (CLASS)

### What CLASS Measures

CLASS (Classroom Assessment Scoring System) is a research-based tool measuring teacher-child interactions:

| Domain | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Emotional Support** | Positive climate, teacher sensitivity, regard for child perspective |
| **Classroom Organization** | Behavior management, productivity, learning formats |
| **Instructional Support** | Concept development, quality of feedback, language modeling |

### Why Interactions Matter

Research shows the quality of teacher-child interactions is one of the strongest predictors of child outcomes — more than materials, curriculum, or environment.

### What Good Interactions Look Like

```
✓ Warm, positive tone
✓ Teachers at child level
✓ Back-and-forth conversations
✓ Open-ended questions
✓ Responsive to children's interests
✓ Extending children's thinking
✓ Encouraging effort, not just results
```

### What to Watch For During Visits

```
□ How do teachers greet children?
□ How do teachers respond when children are upset?
□ Do teachers have conversations WITH children (not just TO them)?
□ Do teachers ask questions that require thinking?
□ Is the atmosphere warm or stressed?
```
