## Why Check Licenses?

Before choosing a childcare provider, you should:

2. **Check for violations** — Understand any past compliance issues
3. **Review inspection history** — See how the facility has been monitored
4. **Confirm basic information** — Capacity, ages served, contact info

## Reading Inspection Reports

### What Inspectors Check

- Adult-to-child ratios maintained
- Staff qualifications and clearances
- Health and safety practices
- Physical environment
- Record keeping
- Discipline policies
- Emergency preparedness

### Types of Visits

| Visit Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Annual/Random** | Routine compliance check |
| **Complaint** | Responding to reported concerns |
| **Follow-up** | Verifying corrections made |
| **Pre-licensing** | Before issuing new license |

### Inspection Reports Since April 2015

The online database includes reports from April 2015 forward. Each report shows:
- Date of visit
- Type of visit
- Deficiencies found (if any)
- Plan of correction required

---

## Understanding Violations

### Not All Violations Are Equal

**Type A (Immediate):** Poses immediate risk to health/safety
- Must be corrected immediately or within 24 hours
- Example: Unsupervised children, firearms accessible

**Type B (Non-Immediate):** Does not pose immediate risk
- Correction plan with reasonable timeline
- Example: Incomplete paperwork, minor maintenance issues

### Most Common Violations

| Violation | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Absence of supervision** | Children not monitored by qualified adult |
| **Ratio violations** | Too many children for staff present |
| **Record deficiencies** | Missing or incomplete documentation |
| **Health/safety** | Hazards, cleanliness, or maintenance issues |
| **Background clearance** | Staff not properly cleared |

### Civil Penalties

Serious violations can result in fines:
- $50+/day for most violations
- Higher amounts for injuries or deaths
- Repeated violations = escalating penalties

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Concerning Patterns

```
⚠️ Multiple "absence of supervision" violations
⚠️ Same violations repeated within 12 months
⚠️ License on probation or in revocation
⚠️ Violations involving injury to children
⚠️ Background clearance problems
```

### What's Usually NOT Concerning

```
✓ Minor paperwork deficiencies (corrected quickly)
✓ Single isolated violation (not repeated)
✓ Older violations with clean recent history
✓ Violations during transition or expansion
```

## If Records Don't Appear Online

### For Historical Reports (Before April 2015)

You must view records in person at the regional licensing office.

**Find your regional office:** [cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/child-care-licensing](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/child-care-licensing)

### Request a File Review

1. Call the regional office
2. Schedule an appointment to view records
3. Bring ID
4. You can take notes but may not photograph records

### Providers Must Share Recent Violations

**Know your rights:** Licensed providers must keep 3 years of confirmed violation reports and show them to parents upon request.

## Step-by-Step: Complete Provider Check

### Before Visiting a Provider

```
□ Search the CCLD database for license status
□ Note the license number, capacity, and ages served
□ Review inspection reports from last 3 years
□ Look for patterns in violations (not just single incidents)
□ Check if any violations involved children's safety
□ Note how quickly violations were corrected
```

### Questions to Ask the Provider

```
□ Can I see your current license? (Must be posted)
□ Can I see your last 3 years of inspection reports?
□ Have you had any recent licensing visits?
□ Are all staff background-cleared?
□ What is your current enrollment vs. capacity?
```

### During Your Visit

```
□ Is the license posted in a visible location?
□ Does the number of children appear within capacity?
□ Are there adequate adults for the children present?
□ Does the environment appear safe and clean?
□ Are children being supervised at all times?
```

## Special Situations

### New Providers (No History)

- License status may show "Pending" or recently issued
- No violation history doesn't mean perfect — just no inspections yet
- Ask about the provider's previous experience
- Check if they operated under a different license before

### Providers Who Moved

- Licenses are location-specific
- A provider who moved has a NEW license number
- Search by provider name to find history at previous location

### Family Child Care Confusion

- Small FCC providers are listed by their personal name
- The "facility name" IS the provider's name
- Format must be exact: "Lastname, Firstname"
