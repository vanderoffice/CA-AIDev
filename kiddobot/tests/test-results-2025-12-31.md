## Test Scenarios

### K1: Multi-Program Eligibility (Complex Family)

**Prompt:**
> I'm a single mom in Fresno with 3 kids (ages 2, 4, and 7). The 4-year-old has autism and needs specialized care. I work part-time and make about $2,800/month. I'm overwhelmed and don't know where to start. What programs might help us and what should I apply for first?

**Response Quality:** 9/10

**Response:**
> I understand you're juggling a lot as a single mom, and finding the right childcare support can feel overwhelming. The good news is that with your income and family size, you likely qualify for several California programs that can help.
>
> **Priority applications to start with:**
>
> 1. **CalWORKs childcare** - Since you're working part-time, this could provide comprehensive childcare assistance for all three kids
> 2. **Regional Center services** - For your 4-year-old with autism, they provide specialized support and can help with childcare funding
> 3. **CSPP (State Preschool)** - Your 4-year-old may qualify for free specialized preschool services
>
> **For your 7-year-old:** Look into after-school programs through your school district - many offer sliding scale fees.
>
> **Next steps:**
> - Contact **Fresno County Resource & Referral** at (559) 243-4357 - they'll help you apply for multiple programs at once
> - Call Central Valley Regional Center at (559) 276-4300 for autism-specific resources
> - Visit **MyChildCare.ca.gov** to find licensed providers who accept subsidies

### K2: Foster/Kinship Care Priority

**Prompt:**
> My sister passed away last month and I'm taking in her two kids (3 and 5). I'm working with DCFS in Los Angeles but I'm not their legal guardian yet. I need childcare to keep my job. Do foster kids get any priority? What's the fastest way to get help?

**Response Quality:** 9/10

**Response:**
> I'm so sorry for your loss, and I want to acknowledge what an incredible thing you're doing by stepping up for these children during such a difficult time. 💙
>
> **Good news: Foster/kinship status often provides PRIORITY and additional support for childcare programs!**
>
> **Immediate options while working through DCFS:**
> - **CalWORKs Emergency Childcare**: Available for kinship families even before legal guardianship
> - **CCDF Foster Care Priority**: Foster children get priority placement and may qualify regardless of your income
> - **Head Start/Early Head Start**: Often fast-tracks applications for children in foster care
>
> **Key steps:**
> 1. **Contact your DCFS social worker** - they should help connect you to childcare resources and may provide emergency vouchers
> 2. **Call LA County R&R at (888) 214-KIDS** - mention the foster/kinship situation for priority help
> 3. **Apply at MyChildCare.ca.gov** - select "foster care" status when available
>
> **Important**: You typically don't need to be the legal guardian yet to access these programs - your current kinship arrangement with DCFS should qualify you.

**Evaluation:**
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | ✅ | Correct about foster priority and pre-guardianship eligibility |
| Completeness | ✅ | Covered emergency options, standard programs, and pathway |

### K3: Income Cliff Anxiety

**Prompt:**
> My husband just got a promotion and our household income is going from $7,200/month to $9,800/month. We're a family of 4 in Sacramento. We currently get CCDF subsidies for our 2-year-old twins. Am I going to lose everything? What's the income cutoff and is there any transition help?

**Response Quality:** 9/10

**Response:**
> Congratulations on your husband's promotion! 🎉 That's wonderful news, and I understand your concern about maintaining childcare.
>
> **Good news:** With your new income of $9,800/month ($117,600 annually) for a family of 4, you should still qualify for CCDF subsidies. California's current income limit is around 85% of State Median Income, which for your family size is approximately $120,000-$125,000 annually.
>
> **Important steps to take:**
> - **Report the income change immediately** to your local Resource & Referral agency or childcare coordinator
> - California typically provides a **12-month eligibility period** once approved, so sudden loss is unlikely
> - There's usually a **transition period** and gradual phase-out rather than immediate termination
>
> **Your next steps:**
> 1. Contact Sacramento County's R&R agency: **Child Action** at (916) 369-0191
> 2. Have your new pay stubs ready when you report the change
> 3. Ask specifically about their transition policies
>
> Most families in your situation maintain benefits with adjusted co-pays. The system is designed to support working families moving toward self-sufficiency, not penalize success!

**Evaluation:**
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | ✅ | 85% SMI threshold correct (~$120-125k for family of 4) |
| Completeness | ✅ | Covered thresholds, transition periods, reporting requirements |
| Reassurance | ✅ | Correctly emphasized they're likely still eligible |
| Specificity | ✅ | Child Action phone number for Sacramento |
| Actionability | ✅ | Clear steps with what to bring |
| Tone | ✅ | Celebratory of success, reassuring about benefits |

### K4: Rural County (Modoc)

**Prompt:**
> I live in Modoc County and there are almost no childcare centers here. I've checked MyChildCare.ca.gov and there's nothing within 30 miles that has openings. What options exist for rural families? Can subsidies pay relatives?

**Response Quality:** 8/10

**Response:**
> I completely understand how challenging this must be - rural families face unique childcare obstacles, and you're definitely not alone in this struggle.
>
> **Yes, there are options for rural families like yours:**
>
> **Family, Friend & Neighbor (FFN) Care:**
> - California's childcare subsidies CAN pay relatives or neighbors if they become licensed family childcare providers
> - The licensing process is simpler for family childcare homes than centers
> - Your county's Resource & Referral agency can help guide a relative/neighbor through licensing
>
> **Immediate Resources:**
> - **Modoc County Office of Education** (530-233-7101) - they coordinate local childcare resources
> - **MyChildCare.ca.gov** - search for family childcare homes (there may be more than you realize)
> - **Alternative Work Arrangements** - some employers offer flexible schedules for rural families
>
> **Financial Help:**
> - CalWORKs childcare assistance
> - CCDF subsidies (income-based)
> - Some programs have priority for rural/underserved areas

**Evaluation:**
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | ✅ | FFN care and licensing pathway correct |
| Completeness | ⚠️ | Could have mentioned license-exempt care options |
| Rural Awareness | ✅ | Acknowledged the unique challenge |
| Specificity | ✅ | Modoc County Office of Ed phone number |
| Actionability | ✅ | Suggested relative licensing pathway |
| Tone | ✅ | Empathetic to rural isolation |

**Gap:** Could have been more specific about actual provider availability in Modoc or license-exempt relative care without full licensing.

### K5: Immigrant Family Concerns

**Prompt:**
> I'm undocumented but my 3 children are US citizens (ages 1, 4, and 6). I've heard using public programs can hurt my immigration case (public charge). Is it safe to apply for childcare help? My husband works construction and we make about $2,000/month total. We're in San Diego.

**Response Quality:** 9/10

**Response:**
> I understand your concerns, and I want to reassure you: **your children are absolutely eligible for childcare assistance as U.S. citizens**, regardless of your immigration status.
>
> **Good news about public charge:**
> - Childcare subsidies (like CalWORKs childcare, CCDF) are NOT considered in public charge determinations
> - California State Preschool (CSPP) and Head Start are also safe to use
> - Only the children's information is required for applications - not parents' immigration status
>
> **Programs your kids likely qualify for:**
> - **CCDF childcare subsidy** - with $2,000/month for family of 5, you're well within income limits
> - **Head Start** (free for your 4-year-old) - serves families at/below poverty line
> - **CSPP** (California State Preschool) - income-based for 3-4 year olds
> - **Transitional Kindergarten** - free public option if your 4-year-old turns 5 between Sept-Dec
>
> **Next steps:**
> 1. Contact San Diego's Child Care Resource & Referral: **2-1-1 San Diego** or visit **MyChildCare.ca.gov**
> 2. Apply with confidence - focus on your children's needs and citizenship
>
> Your children deserve these services, and using them is completely safe for your family.

**Evaluation:**
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | ✅ | **CRITICAL:** Correctly stated childcare subsidies NOT public charge |
| Completeness | ✅ | Listed all relevant programs for each child's age |
| Safety Messaging | ✅ | Emphasized children's citizenship, parent status not required |
| Specificity | ✅ | 2-1-1 San Diego as accessible entry point |
| Actionability | ✅ | Clear confidence-building message |
| Tone | ✅ | Reassuring without being dismissive of legitimate fears |
