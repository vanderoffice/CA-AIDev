# Journey: CalWORKs Stage Transitions

**Scenario:** You're receiving CalWORKs cash aid and need to understand childcare as you move through the stages toward self-sufficiency.

**Timeline:** Ongoing—stages transition automatically based on your status

---

## Starting Point

You are:
- Currently receiving CalWORKs (TANF) cash assistance
- Have children who need care while you work or train
- Participating in Welfare-to-Work (WTW) activities
- Unsure how childcare stages work or what happens when you leave cash aid

## Goal

- Maintain continuous childcare through all transitions
- Understand what triggers each stage change
- Know your rights and responsibilities
- Avoid gaps in care during transitions
- Eventually transition to stable, subsidized childcare after leaving cash aid

## Phase 1: Stage 1 — While Receiving Cash Aid

### What Stage 1 Covers

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Who's eligible** | Anyone receiving CalWORKs with children needing care |
| **Who runs it** | County welfare office |
| **What activities qualify** | Work, job search, education, training, WTW activities |
| **Provider types** | Any licensed center, licensed FCC, or TrustLine FFN |
| **Cost to you** | Usually $0 (no family fee while on cash aid) |
| **How long** | As long as you're receiving cash aid |

### How to Get Stage 1 Care

Stage 1 is connected to your CalWORKs case. Your eligibility worker should:

1. [ ] Discuss childcare needs during your WTW assessment
2. [ ] Authorize childcare based on your approved activities
3. [ ] Issue a referral for childcare

**If childcare wasn't offered, ask your worker:**
> "I need childcare to participate in my WTW activities. Can you authorize Stage 1 childcare?"

### Choosing Your Provider

You can use:
- **Licensed childcare centers** — Must accept CalWORKs
- **Licensed family childcare homes** — Must accept CalWORKs
- **License-exempt caregivers** — Must be TrustLine registered

**To use a family member (FFN):**
1. They cannot live with you
2. They must be 18+ years old
3. They must pass TrustLine background check (apply at trustline.org)
4. They cannot be your child's parent

### Your Responsibilities in Stage 1

| Responsibility | Consequence of Not Meeting |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Participate in WTW activities | Childcare may be terminated |
| Report schedule changes | Hours won't be authorized |
| Report any income changes | Affects both cash aid and care |
| Use an approved provider | Care won't be paid |

---

## Phase 2: Transitioning to Stage 2 — Leaving Cash Aid

### What Triggers Stage 2?

You move to Stage 2 when you:
- Get a job and your income exceeds cash aid limits
- Time out of CalWORKs cash aid
- Voluntarily leave CalWORKs

**This transition should be automatic.** Your county transfers your case to the APP contractor.

### Timeline for Transition

```
LAST CASH AID CHECK              STAGE 2 BEGINS
         │                              │
         ├──────────────────────────────┤
         │      Transition Period       │
         │       (should be seamless)   │
         │                              │
    Day 0                          Day 1 of Stage 2
         │                              │
         ↓                              ↓
   County notifies APP          APP contacts you
   (should happen automatically)  (within 2 weeks)
```

### What You Should Do During Transition

**Before your last cash aid payment:**
1. [ ] Ask your county worker: "Who is my Stage 2 APP contractor?"
2. [ ] Get the APP contractor's contact information
3. [ ] Confirm your childcare will continue without interruption

**After leaving cash aid:**
1. [ ] Wait for APP contractor to contact you (usually within 2 weeks)
2. [ ] If you don't hear within 2 weeks, **call them**
3. [ ] Complete any new paperwork they require
4. [ ] Continue using the same provider (no change needed)

### What Changes in Stage 2

| Feature | Stage 1 | Stage 2 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Who runs it | County | APP contractor |
| Family fees | Usually $0 | Based on income |
| Income limit | N/A (on cash aid) | 85% SMI (~$90K for family of 3) |
| Recertification | Tied to cash aid | Every 12 months |
| Duration | Unlimited while on aid | 24 months |

### Potential Problem: The Transition Gap

**Red flags:**
- Your provider says they haven't been paid
- You get a bill you didn't expect
- No one contacts you about Stage 2

**What to do:**
1. Call your county CalWORKs office
2. Ask: "Was my Stage 2 transfer completed?"
3. Get confirmation of your APP contractor
4. Call the APP contractor directly

---

## Phase 3: Stage 2 — Building Self-Sufficiency

### Your Stage 2 Rights

| Right | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| 24 months of care | Full 24 months from Stage 2 start date |
| Keep same provider | No requirement to change providers |
| 12-month eligibility | Can't be terminated mid-year for income increases |
| Reasonable family fee | Based on your income, capped |

### Your Stage 2 Responsibilities

| Responsibility | How Often | Consequence |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Work or approved activity | Ongoing | Loss of eligibility |
| Report income changes | Within 5 days | Over/underpayment issues |
| Recertify | Every 12 months | Service termination |
| Pay family fee | Monthly | Provider may terminate |

### Important: The 24-Month Clock

Stage 2 lasts **24 months** from your first day. After that:
- If still income-eligible → Transfer to Stage 3
- If over income limits → Childcare ends

**Track your dates:**
- Stage 2 start date: ____________
- 12-month recertification: ____________
- 24-month end date: ____________

---

## Phase 4: Transitioning to Stage 3 — Long-Term Stability

### What Triggers Stage 3?

After 24 months in Stage 2, if you're still income-eligible (<85% SMI), you move to Stage 3.

### Stage 3 Benefits

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Duration | Until your youngest child turns 13 |
| Income limit | Same 85% SMI |
| Provider choice | Same flexibility |
| Stability | Longest-term subsidy available |

### Stage 2 → Stage 3 Transition

**This should also be automatic.** Your APP contractor manages both stages.

**Checklist:**
1. [ ] Around month 22 of Stage 2, ask your APP: "Will I transfer to Stage 3?"
2. [ ] Confirm you're still income-eligible
3. [ ] Complete any recertification paperwork
4. [ ] Confirm your provider continues unchanged

---

## Common Obstacles & Solutions

### "I stopped getting cash aid but no one contacted me about Stage 2"

**This is a system failure, not your fault.**

**Action:**
1. Call your county CalWORKs office immediately
2. Say: "I left cash aid on [date] and need Stage 2 childcare"
3. Ask them to expedite the transfer
4. Get the APP contractor contact and call them directly
5. Document everything—dates, who you talked to

### "My Stage 2 is ending but I still need help"

**Check your income:**
- Under 85% SMI → You should transfer to Stage 3 automatically
- Over 85% SMI → You may need to find other options (CSPP, Head Start, private)

**If you should be in Stage 3 but no one contacted you:**
1. Call your APP contractor
2. Ask: "Am I being transferred to Stage 3?"
3. Request expedited processing

### "I got a new job and my schedule changed"

**You must report this within 5 days.**

**Action:**
1. Call your APP contractor
2. Provide new work schedule
3. Request authorization update
4. Get new authorization in writing
5. Notify your provider

### "My family fee increased significantly"

**This happens when income increases.** But fees are based on a schedule.

**Check:**
1. Is the fee calculation correct? ([See fee schedules](../03_Costs_and_Affordability/Family_Fee_Schedules.md))
2. Did they use correct family size?
3. Did they account for all deductions?

**If incorrect:**
1. Request a breakdown of the calculation
2. Provide corrected income documentation
3. Request recalculation
4. Appeal if still incorrect

### "I need to change providers"

**You have the right to change providers at any time.**

**Steps:**
1. Find new provider (verify they accept your subsidy)
2. Notify APP contractor of intended change
3. Get new provider authorized BEFORE starting care
4. Notify old provider of end date
5. Complete enrollment with new provider

## What Happens After Stage 3?

Stage 3 continues until your youngest child turns 13 (or 21 if disabled), as long as you:
- Remain income-eligible
- Continue working or in approved activity
- Complete annual recertification
- Pay family fees

When Stage 3 ends, you may transition to:
- No subsidy (if income too high)
- Different program (CSPP, Head Start) if child is appropriate age
