# Journey: Crisis Situation

**Scenario:** You need childcare urgently due to an emergency—homelessness, fleeing domestic violence, sudden job change, or other crisis.

**Timeline:** Immediate—days to weeks, not months

---

## Starting Point

You are:
- Facing a crisis that requires immediate childcare
- May be experiencing homelessness
- May be fleeing domestic violence
- May have suddenly lost your job or childcare
- May be in CPS/child welfare involvement
- Cannot wait weeks or months for "normal" processes

## Goal

- Get safe childcare within days, not weeks
- Access priority enrollment where available
- Stabilize your situation while maintaining care for your child
- Understand your rights to expedited services
- Build toward long-term childcare stability

---

## Your Priority Status

**CRITICAL:** If you're experiencing any of these, you have **Priority 1** status:

| Situation | Priority Status | Documentation Required |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Homeless | Priority 1 | Self-declaration only |
| Foster/kinship care | Priority 1 | Placement documentation |
| CPS-involved | Priority 1 | Social worker letter |
| At risk of abuse/neglect | Priority 1 | Self-declaration or referral |
| Domestic violence | Priority 1 | Self-declaration or shelter |

**What Priority 1 means:** You skip to the front of waitlists. Programs must serve you before families who have waited longer.

---

## Immediate Actions (Day 1-3)

### Step 1: Call 211

**Dial 2-1-1** (or visit [211.org](https://211.org))

211 is your single point of contact for crisis resources including:
- Emergency childcare referrals

- Domestic violence resources
- Mental health crisis support

**Tell them:**
> "I'm in a crisis and need childcare immediately. [Describe your situation briefly.]"

### Step 2: Contact Your Local CCR&R

Find at [rrnetwork.org](https://rrnetwork.org/about/r-r-directory)

**Tell them:**
> "I need emergency childcare. I am [homeless/fleeing DV/in crisis]. I understand I may have priority status."

**Ask:**
- What emergency childcare options exist?
- Can you expedite my subsidy application?
- Are there any crisis childcare programs?
- Can you refer me directly to a provider with openings?

### Step 3: Apply for Priority Enrollment

**Apply TODAY to:**
- Head Start (Priority 1 for homeless, foster, CPS)

**You can apply while homeless—you don't need:**

## By Situation

### If You're Experiencing Homelessness

**Your rights under McKinney-Vento Act:**

| Right | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| Immediate enrollment | Programs cannot delay enrollment for any reason |
| No address required | Use shelter address, "no fixed address," or CCR&R address |
| Self-declaration | You state your status—no proof required |
| No documentation barrier | Can enroll without typical paperwork |
| Transportation | Help getting to childcare/school |

**Definition of homeless includes:**
- Living in a shelter (emergency or transitional)
- Staying in a hotel/motel due to lack of housing
- Doubled up with others due to economic hardship
- Living in a car, park, or other public place
- Substandard housing (no utilities, condemned)

**Action steps:**
1. [ ] Tell every program: "I am experiencing homelessness"
2. [ ] Self-declare if asked for documentation
3. [ ] Contact school district homeless liaison (for school-age children)
4. [ ] Apply for Head Start (automatic eligibility)
5. [ ] Don't wait for housing stability to get childcare

### If You're Fleeing Domestic Violence

**Your safety is the priority.**

**Immediate resources:**
- **National DV Hotline:** 1-800-799-7233 (24/7)
- **CA Partnership to End DV:** [cpedv.org](https://cpedv.org)
- **Local DV shelter:** Via 211

**Childcare while in shelter:**
- Many DV shelters have on-site childcare
- Shelter can provide documentation for priority enrollment
- You have priority status for all subsidized childcare
- Address can be confidential (shelter address or CCR&R)

**Action steps:**
1. [ ] Get to safety first
2. [ ] Ask shelter about childcare services or referrals
3. [ ] Apply for Priority 1 subsidized care
4. [ ] Use shelter address for enrollment
5. [ ] Request confidentiality for your records

### If CPS/Child Welfare Is Involved

**Childcare is often part of your case plan.**

**What you're entitled to:**
- Priority 1 enrollment in subsidized care
- Childcare as part of case plan services
- Support from your social worker to arrange care

**Action steps:**
1. [ ] Ask your CW social worker about childcare
2. [ ] Request childcare be added to case plan
3. [ ] Get a letter from your worker for enrollment
4. [ ] Apply for Priority 1 status at APP/Head Start

### If You Lost Your Job Suddenly

**You have time to find care before losing eligibility.**

**12-month eligibility protection:**
- If already enrolled in subsidized care, you keep eligibility for 12 months
- You don't lose care just because you lost your job
- Use this time to find work and stabilize

**If not yet enrolled:**
1. [ ] Contact CCR&R immediately
2. [ ] Apply for CalWORKs if income-eligible (includes Stage 1 care)
3. [ ] Apply for APP subsidies
4. [ ] Job search qualifies as "activity" for childcare

### If Your Provider Suddenly Closed

**This happens—providers close without warning.**

**Immediate steps:**
1. [ ] Contact your APP contractor or county office
2. [ ] Request emergency authorization for new provider
3. [ ] Contact CCR&R for provider referrals
4. [ ] Ask about temporary care while you find permanent placement

**You may be able to:**
- Use temporary license-exempt care (family member)
- Get expedited authorization for new provider
- Receive help from CCR&R finding openings

---

## Emergency Childcare Options

### Crisis Nurseries

Some areas have **crisis nurseries** for emergency short-term care:
- No appointment needed
- Open extended hours
- For crisis situations only (not regular care)

**Ask 211:** "Are there crisis nursery services in my area?"

### Temporary Family Care

If you need someone to watch your child while you stabilize:
- **License-exempt care:** Family members or friends (no license needed)
- **Must be TrustLine registered** for subsidies
- Contact CCR&R about emergency FFN authorization

### Respite Care

For children with disabilities, Regional Center may provide emergency respite.

**Contact your Regional Center** and explain the emergency.

---

## Documentation for Priority Status

### Self-Declaration (Often Sufficient)

For homeless status, you typically just need to sign a self-declaration form stating:
- Where you're currently staying
- Why it's temporary/inadequate
- That you lack fixed, regular, adequate housing

**Programs have these forms. Just ask.**

### If Documentation Is Available

| Situation | Helpful (Not Required) Documents |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Homeless | Shelter letter, case manager statement |
| DV | Shelter letter, restraining order |
| CPS | Social worker letter, case number |
| Foster care | Placement letter, court documents |

**Remember:** Documentation is NOT required for immediate enrollment. Programs cannot deny you for lack of paperwork.

## Sample Scripts

### Calling 211
> "Hi, I'm in a crisis situation—I'm [homeless/fleeing DV/etc.] and I need childcare for my [age] year old right away. I also need help with [housing/food/other needs]. Can you help me find emergency resources?"

### Calling CCR&R
> "Hello, I need urgent help finding childcare. I'm experiencing [crisis situation] and I understand I may have priority status. Can you help me apply for emergency subsidies and find a provider with immediate openings?"

### Contacting Head Start
> "I'd like to apply for my child to enroll in Head Start. We're currently [homeless/in foster care/etc.] so I believe we have priority enrollment. How quickly can we get started?"

### Enrolling Without Address
> "I don't have a permanent address right now. I'm staying at [shelter/with family/in my car]. Can you use [shelter address/CCR&R address/general mail] for my application?"

---

## Timeline Expectations

| Step | Crisis Timeline | Normal Timeline |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| CCR&R consultation | Same day | 1-2 weeks |
| Subsidy application | Same week | 2-4 weeks |
| Provider search | 1-3 days | 2-4 weeks |
| Start care | 1-2 weeks | 4-8 weeks |

**Advocate for urgency.** If someone says "normal processing is 4 weeks," explain:
> "I'm in a crisis situation and cannot wait that long. Is there any way to expedite this?"

---

## Common Obstacles & Solutions

### "They say I need documents I don't have"

**Response:**
> "I understand documentation is usually required, but I'm in a crisis situation. The McKinney-Vento Act [if homeless] requires immediate enrollment without documentation. Can we proceed with a self-declaration?"

### "There's no availability anywhere"

**Options:**
- Ask CCR&R to call providers directly on your behalf
- Consider license-exempt care (family/friends) temporarily
- Ask about expanding your search area
- Check if crisis nursery exists
- Ask 211 for any emergency options

### "I can't afford the family fee"

**Options:**
- Request fee waiver due to crisis
- Ask about emergency financial assistance
- Contact local charities via 211
- Head Start has no fees ever
- CalWORKs Stage 1 typically has no fees

### "They're asking where I'll be living"

**Response:**
> "I don't have stable housing right now. I'm experiencing homelessness. I can use [shelter address / general delivery / CCR&R address] for mail."
