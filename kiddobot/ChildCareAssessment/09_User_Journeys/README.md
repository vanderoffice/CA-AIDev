             (if on cash aid)

Special circumstances overlay ANY journey:
• Child has disability → Also see Special Needs journey
• Experiencing homelessness → Priority status in most programs
```

### Combine Journeys

Many families fit multiple scenarios. For example:
- **New parent + Special needs:** Start with New Parent, add Special Needs steps
- **CalWORKs + Crisis:** Use Crisis for immediate help, then CalWORKs for long-term
- **Any situation + Homelessness:** You have priority access—mention it upfront
