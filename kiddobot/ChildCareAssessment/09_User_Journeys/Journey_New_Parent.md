## Phase 1: Research & Planning (Start 4-6 Months Before)

### Week 1-2: Understand Your Options

**Action Items:**
1. [ ] Determine your return-to-work date
2. [ ] Calculate your childcare budget
3. [ ] Research what subsidies you might qualify for

**Key Decision: What Can You Afford?**

| Your Situation | Likely Best Options |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Income under Federal Poverty Level | Head Start, CSPP, APP |
| Income under ~$90K (family of 3) | CSPP, APP |
| Higher income | Tax credits, employer benefits, private pay |
| Any income + child with disability | Regional Center, Head Start 10% slots |

**Tools:**
- Use the [Income Eligibility Calculator](https://mychildcareplan.org) to check subsidy eligibility
- Check [Family Fee Schedules](../03_Costs_and_Affordability/Family_Fee_Schedules.md) for expected costs

### Week 3-4: Contact Your Local CCR&R

**Why This Matters:** Your local Child Care Resource & Referral (CCR&R) is your free guide to the system. They can:
- Explain all your options
- Tell you about local waitlists
- Refer you to specific providers
- Help with subsidy applications

**Action Items:**
1. [ ] Find your CCR&R at [rrnetwork.org](https://rrnetwork.org/about/r-r-directory)
2. [ ] Call or email to schedule a consultation
3. [ ] Ask about:
   - Infant care availability in your area
   - Subsidy programs you might qualify for
   - Current waitlist times

**What to Have Ready:**
- Your expected return-to-work date
- Your work schedule (or best guess)
- Your approximate household income
- Your zip code and preferred care location

---

## Phase 2: Apply for Assistance (Months 2-3)

### If You Might Qualify for Subsidies

**Apply NOW—before baby arrives.** Waitlists can be long.

| Program | How to Apply | Timeline |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Head Start / Early Head Start | Contact local grantee at [headstartca.org](https://headstartca.org) | Apply 3+ months ahead |
| CSPP | Contact local school district | Enrollment typically spring |
| APP | Through your CCR&R | 2-4 week processing + waitlist |

**Application Checklist:**
- [ ] Income verification (pay stubs, tax return)
- [ ] Proof of pregnancy or baby's birth certificate
- [ ] Proof of address
- [ ] Work schedule or return-to-work letter from employer
- [ ] ID for parent

### If You're Paying Privately

**Start researching providers now.** Infant care is the hardest to find.

**Action Items:**
1. [ ] Search [MyChildCarePlan.org](https://mychildcareplan.org) or [MyChildCare.ca.gov](https://mychildcare.ca.gov)
2. [ ] Ask friends, neighbors, coworkers for recommendations
3. [ ] Create a list of 5-10 potential providers
4. [ ] Call each to check infant availability

**Questions to Ask:**
- Do you have infant openings for [your start date]?
- What's your staff-to-infant ratio?
- What are your hours?
- What's your monthly rate?
- Is there a waitlist? How long?

---

## Phase 3: Tour & Evaluate Providers (Month 3-4)

### Schedule Tours

Visit at least 3 providers before deciding. Try to visit during active hours (not nap time).

**Tour Checklist:**

| Area | What to Look For |
|------|------------------|
| **Safety** | Outlet covers, gated stairs, cribs meet standards |
| **Cleanliness** | Clean diaper area, sanitized toys, no odors |
| **Staff** | Warm interactions, responding to cries, engaged |
| **Ratios** | 1:3 or 1:4 for infants (varies by license type) |
| **Feeding** | Breast milk storage, formula prep, feeding on demand |
| **Sleep** | Safe sleep practices, separate cribs, supervision |

**Questions to Ask During Tour:**
- How do you handle separation anxiety?
- What's your sick child policy?
- How do you communicate with parents daily?
- What's your philosophy on feeding and sleep schedules?
- Can I drop in unannounced?

### Verify Credentials

Before committing:
1. [ ] Check license at [CCLD Search](https://www.ccld.dss.ca.gov/carefacilitysearch/)
2. [ ] Review any inspection reports
3. [ ] Check for citations or complaints
4. [ ] Ask about staff background checks

---

## Phase 4: Make Your Decision (Month 4-5)

### Compare Your Options

Create a comparison chart:

| Factor | Provider A | Provider B | Provider C |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Location/commute | | | |
| Hours (match your work) | | | |
| Cost (monthly) | | | |
| Your gut feeling | | | |
| Availability | | | |
| Quality rating | | | |

### Secure Your Spot

Once you decide:
1. [ ] Notify the provider of your acceptance
2. [ ] Complete enrollment paperwork
3. [ ] Pay any required deposit
4. [ ] Provide medical/immunization forms
5. [ ] Get written confirmation of start date

**Important:** Keep other options warm until you're 100% confirmed. "We're still deciding" is fine.

---

## Phase 5: Prepare for Transition (Final Month)

### Before First Day

**For You:**
- [ ] Complete all paperwork with provider
- [ ] Set up payment method
- [ ] Pack the diaper bag (diapers, wipes, change of clothes, comfort item)
- [ ] Arrange breast milk/formula supplies
- [ ] Practice the morning routine
- [ ] Identify your backup care options

**For Baby:**
- [ ] Schedule pediatrician for required forms
- [ ] Ensure immunizations are up to date
- [ ] Start adjusting to provider's nap/feed schedule if possible

### Separation Strategy

**Week Before:**
- Do 1-2 short visits with baby at the provider
- Leave baby for 30-60 minutes while you wait nearby

**First Week:**
- Day 1: Half day
- Day 2-3: Gradually extend
- Day 4-5: Full day

**It's Normal:**
- For baby to cry at drop-off
- For you to cry at drop-off
- For the first week to be emotional
- To call and check in

## Common Obstacles & Solutions

### "I can't find infant care anywhere"

**Why:** Infant care is expensive to provide (low ratios = fewer spots).

**Solutions:**
- Start earlier—6+ months before needed
- Expand your search radius
- Consider family childcare homes (smaller, often more infant slots)
- Look at nanny shares
- Check with your employer about on-site care

### "I'm on multiple waitlists and haven't heard back"

**Action:**
- Call monthly to confirm you're still active
- Ask your position on the list
- Update them on any changes (priority status, contact info)
- Apply to additional providers

### "The cost is overwhelming"

**Options to Explore:**
- Employer Dependent Care FSA (up to $5,000 pre-tax)
- Federal Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit
- California tax credit (additional credit)
- Check if you qualify for any subsidies (even higher incomes may qualify)
- Ask provider about sibling discounts or payment plans

### "I got approved for a subsidy but there's no provider with openings"

**This is common.** Your approval is typically valid for 60-90 days while you find care.

**Solutions:**
- Ask your APP contractor for help finding openings
- Consider license-exempt care (family member with TrustLine) temporarily
- Expand your search area
- Request an extension if needed
