**IEP can include:**
- Special education preschool
- Related services (speech, OT, PT)

---

## Phase 3: Coordinating Childcare (Months 2-6)

### Option 1: Regional Center Childcare Funding

Regional Centers can fund childcare as a "respite" or family support service.

**What it covers:**
- All or part of childcare costs
- Care with trained providers
- Specialized care if needed

**How to request:**
1. During your IFSP/IPP meeting, say: "I need childcare to work/train. Can this be included in my service plan?"
2. Provide documentation of your work schedule
3. The service coordinator will assess and potentially approve

**Limitations:**
- Not automatic—must be approved
- May have hour limits
- May require specific providers

### Option 2: Head Start (10% Disability Slots)

Head Start **reserves 10% of enrollment** for children with disabilities.

**Benefits:**
- FREE (no income requirement for disability slots)
- Comprehensive services (health, dental, family support)
- Required to provide accommodations
- Inclusion-focused

**How to access:**
1. Contact local Head Start: [headstartca.org](https://headstartca.org)
2. Disclose your child's disability/IFSP/IEP
3. Ask about "10% disability enrollment"
4. Provide documentation of disability

### Option 3: State Subsidized Programs (CSPP, APP)

Children with disabilities get **Priority 2** status in subsidized programs.

**What this means:**
- Higher placement on waitlists
- Potential income requirement waiver for disability slots
- Providers must make reasonable accommodations

**Required accommodations include:**
- Modifying activities for participation
- Training staff on your child's needs
- Coordinating with therapists
- Physical accessibility

### Option 4: Inclusive Private Childcare

Many private providers welcome children with disabilities.

**How to find inclusive care:**
1. Ask your Regional Center service coordinator for recommendations
2. Contact your CCR&R for providers experienced with special needs
3. Look for Quality Counts California rated providers
4. Ask specific questions during tours

---

## Phase 4: Finding the Right Provider

### Questions to Ask Providers

| Category | Questions |
|----------|-----------|
| **Experience** | Have you cared for children with [specific need] before? |
| | What training have your staff received? |
| **Accommodations** | How would you modify activities for my child? |
| | Can my child's therapist visit during care? |
| **Communication** | How will you share daily updates with me? |
| | Are you willing to implement our IFSP/IEP goals? |
| **Ratios** | What's your staff-to-child ratio? |
| | Can you provide 1:1 support if needed? |
| **Environment** | Is the facility physically accessible? |
| | Do you have adaptive equipment available? |

### Red Flags

Be cautious if a provider:
- Says they "don't take special needs kids"
- Won't meet with you before enrollment
- Refuses to coordinate with your service team
- Has no experience and isn't willing to learn
- Suggests your child needs a "special" (segregated) setting

### Green Flags

Good signs include:
- Asks questions about how to best support your child
- Wants to meet with your service coordinator or therapists
- Has experience with inclusion
- Shows flexibility and creativity
- Views your child as a child first

---

## Phase 5: Coordinating Services

### The Team Approach

Your child may have multiple providers. Coordination is key.

| Team Member | Role | How to Connect |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Regional Center Service Coordinator | Manages IFSP/IPP, approves services | Your primary contact |
| Therapists (SLP, OT, PT) | Provide specialized treatment | Schedule around childcare |
| Childcare Provider | Daily care and inclusion | Share IFSP goals |
| School District | IEP services (age 3+) | Coordinate with childcare |
| Pediatrician | Medical oversight | Provide documentation |
| You | Expert on your child | Lead the team |

### Making It Work

**Request:**
1. Joint meetings when possible (childcare + therapists)
2. Shared communication methods (notebook, app)
3. Therapy during childcare hours if possible
4. Written summaries of goals and strategies

**Document:**
- All service hours and providers
- Progress toward goals
- Any concerns or incidents
- Communication with team members

---

## Common Obstacles & Solutions

### "Regional Center said my child isn't eligible"

**Not all delays qualify.** Regional Center serves:
- Intellectual disability
- Cerebral palsy
- Epilepsy
- Autism
- Conditions similar to intellectual disability
- At-risk infants (birth-3, for Early Start only)

**If denied:**
1. Request the denial in writing
2. Ask about the appeal process
3. Contact [State Council on Developmental Disabilities](https://scdd.ca.gov)
4. Consider school district evaluation (age 3+)
5. Seek private evaluation if needed

### "No childcare will take my child"

**This may be discrimination.** Childcare providers cannot:
- Refuse enrollment solely because of disability
- Require you to provide a 1:1 aide at your expense
- Fail to make reasonable modifications

**What to do:**
1. Document any refusals in writing
2. Ask specifically why they're refusing
3. Contact your CCR&R for providers with inclusion experience
4. Consider filing a complaint with OCR or DFEH if discrimination
5. Ask Regional Center for help finding placement

### "My child was asked to leave childcare"

**Providers can only terminate for:**
- Behavior that poses direct threat (after accommodations tried)
- Needs that fundamentally alter the program
- Your failure to pay fees

**If this happens:**
1. Request the reason in writing
2. Ask what accommodations were attempted
3. Involve your service coordinator
4. Appeal if you believe it's discrimination
5. Find alternative care while appealing

### "Services aren't happening as planned"

**IFSP/IEP services are legal commitments.**

**If services aren't being provided:**
1. Document what's missing
2. Contact your service coordinator
3. Request an IFSP/IEP meeting
4. File a compliance complaint if needed
5. Contact Disability Rights California: [disabilityrightsca.org](https://disabilityrightsca.org)
