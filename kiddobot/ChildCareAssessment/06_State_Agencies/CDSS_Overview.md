## How CDSS Affects Families

### What CDSS Decides

- Whether your income qualifies for subsidies
- How much you pay in family fees
- Maximum amount your provider can be paid
- Documentation requirements for eligibility

### What CDSS Does NOT Decide

- Which provider you choose (your decision)
- Your work schedule authorization (APP determines)
- Whether you qualify for CSPP (CDE program)
- Provider licensing (Community Care Licensing Division, separate from subsidy policy)

*CDSS is the backbone of California's childcare subsidy system. While you'll rarely interact with CDSS directly, their policies determine your eligibility, fees, and provider reimbursement rates.*
