# Subsidy Stacking Guide

**Purpose:** Understand how to legally combine multiple childcare funding sources to maximize affordability.

## What Is Subsidy Stacking?

Subsidy stacking means using **multiple programs** to cover your childcare costs. When done correctly, you can significantly reduce out-of-pocket expenses.

## What Can Be Combined?

### Compatible Combinations

| Primary Program | Can Stack With | How It Works |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Head Start (part-day)** | APP wraparound | APP covers before/after Head Start hours |
| **CSPP (part-day)** | APP wraparound | APP covers extended hours |
| **TK (half-day)** | APP or licensed care | Before/after TK care |
| **Regional Center** | State subsidies | RC may cover specialized portions |
| **State subsidies** | Tax credits | Credit on remaining out-of-pocket |
| **Employer DCFSA** | Tax credit (limited) | FSA up to $5K, credit on remainder |

### What CANNOT Be Combined

| Situation | Why Not |
|-----------|---------|
| Two subsidies for same hours | Cannot double-pay for same time period |
| DCFSA + full tax credit | IRS limits: reduce credit by FSA amount |
| Two state subsidies for same child/hours | One subsidy per time slot |
| Multiple APP authorizations for same care | One authorization covers all |

---

## Stacking Strategy #1: Part-Day + Wraparound

### The Most Common Stack

**Scenario:** Head Start or CSPP provides part-day care, but you need full-day for work.

```
        6 AM    8 AM     12 PM    3 PM     6 PM
          │       │        │        │        │
          ├───────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤
          │       │        │        │        │
        Before  HEAD START/CSPP   After-school
        school  (FREE/Low-cost)   wraparound
        wrap     (3-4 hours)      (APP pays)
        (APP)
```

### How to Set It Up

1. **Enroll in part-day program** (Head Start, CSPP, TK)
2. **Apply for APP subsidy** for remaining hours
3. **Tell APP** about your part-day enrollment
4. **Get authorization** for wraparound care only
5. **Find a provider** who accepts both arrangements

### Example Budget

| Component | Hours | Cost | Who Pays |
|-----------|-------|------|----------|
| Head Start | 3.5 hrs/day | $0 | Federal program |
| Before-school wrap | 1.5 hrs/day | $400/mo value | APP |
| After-school wrap | 3 hrs/day | $500/mo value | APP |
| Family fee | — | $150/mo | You |
| **Total** | **8 hrs/day** | **$150/mo** | — |

---

## Stacking Strategy #2: TK + Childcare

### Combining Free School with Subsidized Care

**Scenario:** Child is in Transitional Kindergarten (free, 3-4 hours), but you work full-time.

| Time Slot | Program | Cost |
|-----------|---------|------|
| 7:00-8:30 AM | Licensed before-school (APP) | Covered by APP |
| 8:30-12:30 PM | TK (school district) | FREE |
| 12:30-6:00 PM | After-school (APP or ASES) | APP or FREE |

### Two Options for After-TK

**Option A: ASES (if available)**
- Free after-school program
- No APP needed for these hours
- May not cover until 6 PM everywhere

**Option B: APP Wraparound**
- Apply for APP for before + after TK
- Provider must be subsidized-eligible
- You pay family fee only

---

## Stacking Strategy #3: Regional Center + State Subsidies

### For Children with Disabilities

Regional Center and state subsidies can work together:

| Funding Source | What It Covers |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Regional Center** | Specialized services, respite, possibly some childcare |
| **Head Start (10% slots)** | Comprehensive early childhood (no income limit) |
| **APP/CSPP** | Additional hours beyond RC-funded care |

### How to Coordinate

1. **Start with Regional Center** — get IFSP/IPP approved
2. **Ask RC** what childcare funding they'll provide
3. **Apply for state subsidies** for any gaps
4. **Disclose all funding sources** on applications
5. **Ensure no hour overlap** in billing

---

## Stacking Strategy #4: Tax Benefits on Top

### After Subsidies, Use Tax Benefits

Even with subsidies, you may have out-of-pocket costs. Use tax benefits on the remainder.

| Tax Benefit | Maximum | What It Covers |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Employer DCFSA** | $5,000/year | Pre-tax childcare spending |
| **Federal Tax Credit** | $600-1,050 (2+ children) | Credit on qualifying expenses |
| **CA State Credit** | ~$500 additional | On top of federal |

### Important: Coordination Required

**You cannot claim tax benefits on costs paid by subsidies.**

Only claim tax benefits on:
- Your family fee
- Costs above subsidy maximum
- Provider charges above subsidy rate
- Non-subsidized care (summer camps, etc.)

### Example

| Cost | Amount | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| Total childcare | $15,000/year | — |
| APP covers | -$10,000 | Subsidy |
| Family fee | $2,000 | Your payment |
| Provider premium | $3,000 | Your payment |
| **Tax-eligible expenses** | **$5,000** | DCFSA/credit eligible |

---

## Stacking Strategy #5: Multiple Children

### Each Child Can Have Own Subsidies

| Child | Age | Programs Stacked |
|-------|-----|------------------|
| Child 1 (age 4) | 4 | Head Start + APP wrap |
| Child 2 (age 7) | 7 | ASES (free) + APP before-school |
| Child 3 (age 1) | 1 | Early Head Start + APP extended |

### Family Fee Considerations

- One family fee may cover all children
- Some programs charge per-child
- Combined programs may reduce total fees

---

## Legal Requirements for Stacking

### What You Must Disclose

When applying for any subsidy, you **must** report:
- Other childcare subsidies received
- Programs child is enrolled in
- Hours of care from each source
- Any funding from other agencies

### What Agencies Verify

| Agency Checks | How |
|---------------|-----|
| Duplicate subsidies | Database cross-reference |
| Hour overlap | Authorization comparison |
| Income | Documentation review |
| Provider eligibility | License verification |

### Consequences of Improper Stacking

- Overpayment recovery (you pay back)
- Loss of subsidy eligibility
- Potential fraud charges (intentional misuse)

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Your Stack

### Step 1: Identify Your Base Program

| If Your Child Is... | Best Base Program |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Under 3, low income | Early Head Start |
| 3-4, low income | Head Start or CSPP |
| 4, any income | Transitional Kindergarten |
| 5+, any income | Public school |
| Has disability | Regional Center + Head Start |

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Hours

```
Hours you need care: _______ per day
Hours from base program: _______ per day
Gap to fill: _______ per day
```

### Step 3: Apply for Wraparound

1. Contact your local CCR&R or APP contractor
2. Explain your base program enrollment
3. Request authorization for remaining hours only
4. Provide documentation of base program hours

### Step 4: Document Everything

Keep copies of:
- Enrollment confirmations from all programs
- Authorization letters
- Payment records
- Provider agreements

## What If Stacking Doesn't Work?

### When You Can't Stack

| Situation | Alternative |
|-----------|-------------|
| No part-day programs available | Apply for full-day APP only |
| Waitlisted for base program | Use full APP until slot opens |
| Income too high for state subsidies | DCFSA + tax credits + private pay |
| Provider won't accept multiple funding | Find provider who will |

### Maximizing Single Programs

If stacking isn't possible, maximize your single program:
- Request maximum authorized hours
- Use full DCFSA ($5,000)
- Claim all eligible tax credits
- Ask about sliding scale fees
