# CalWORKs Child Care: San Diego County Guide

**Population:** ~3.3 million (2nd largest in CA)
**Region:** 1 (Higher Cost of Living)
**Primary Agency:** County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA)

---

## Overview

San Diego County benefits from a well-organized childcare system, with the YMCA Childcare Resource Service as a central coordinator. The county has a good mix of licensed centers and family childcare homes, though infant care remains a bottleneck. Military families are a significant population, and the proximity to the Mexican border creates some unique documentation considerations.

## San Diego-Specific Advantages

### 1. Well-Organized System

San Diego's CCR&R (YMCA CRS) is consistently rated as one of the strongest in California:
- Responsive staff
- Clear processes
- Good bilingual (English/Spanish) support
- Effective coordination between county and APP

### 2. Centralized Waitlist

Unlike LA County's fragmented system, San Diego has a more centralized eligibility list:
- One primary point of contact (YMCA CRS) for Stage 2/3
- Clearer tracking of your place in line
- More predictable process

### 3. Good Provider Mix

San Diego has a reasonable mix of provider types:

| Provider Type | Availability |
|---------------|--------------|
| Licensed Centers | Moderate |
| Family Child Care Homes | Good |
| License-Exempt (FFN) | Available |
| Infant Care | Limited (still a bottleneck) |
| School-Age Programs | Good |

## San Diego-Specific Challenges

### 1. Military Population Impact

San Diego has a large military presence (Navy, Marines, Coast Guard). This affects childcare in several ways:

**For Military Families:**
- You may qualify for Military Child Care in Your Neighborhood (MCCYN)
- If MCCYN waitlist is too long, you CAN apply for California state subsidies
- Deployments can suddenly change family income and "need" documentation

**For Civilian Families:**
- Some providers primarily serve military families
- Military families have separate funding sources, which can affect slot availability

### 2. Border Proximity Considerations

For families living near the Mexican border:
- Cross-border commuting families may have complex schedule documentation needs
- Some families have relatives in Mexico who cannot serve as license-exempt providers (must be in CA)
- Immigration status concerns exist, though remember: child's eligibility is based on the CHILD

### 3. North vs. South County Disparities

| Area | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| **North County (Oceanside, Carlsbad, Escondido)** | More suburban; good mix of providers |
| **Central (San Diego city)** | Urban; more options but higher demand |
| **South County (Chula Vista, National City)** | More FCCHs; strong Spanish-language services |
| **East County (El Cajon, Santee)** | More suburban/rural; fewer providers |

## San Diego Tips

### Getting Off the Waitlist Faster

1. **Apply to multiple places:**
   - County centralized list
   - YMCA CRS
   - Direct with providers you like
   - Head Start/Early Head Start

2. **Know your priority tier:**
   - CPS involvement = top priority
   - CalWORKs recipients = high priority
   - Income-eligible with need = standard priority

3. **Update your information:**
   - If income drops, report it — you may move to a higher priority
   - If you have another child, update your file
   - If CPS becomes involved, inform the agency

### Finding Providers

**Use YMCA CRS referral service:**
- Call (800) 481-2151
- Provide your zip code, age of child, hours needed
- They'll give you a list of providers accepting subsidies

**Search online:**
- MyChildCare.ca.gov for licensed providers
- YMCA CRS website for participating providers

**Consider:**
- Family Child Care Homes if centers are full
- License-exempt care with a relative while waiting
- Before/after school programs for school-age kids

### For Military Families

1. **Check MCCYN first:** Fee Assistance program for military
2. **If MCCYN wait is too long:** Apply for CA state subsidies simultaneously
3. **Deployment documentation:** Keep orders handy for income/schedule changes
4. **PCS moves:** Notify your APP immediately; may need to transfer to new county
