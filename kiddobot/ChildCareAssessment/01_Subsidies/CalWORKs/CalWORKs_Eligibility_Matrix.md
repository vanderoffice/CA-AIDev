## Income Calculation: How Disregards Work

CalWORKs uses generous disregards so working families keep more of their earnings:

### Step 1: $600 Disregard
The first $600 of **earned income** (wages, self-employment) is ignored.

### Step 2: 50% Disregard
After the $600, **50% of remaining earned income** is also ignored.

### Calculation Example

**Family of 3, earning $2,000/month:**

| Step | Calculation | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Gross earnings | — | $2,000 |
| Minus $600 disregard | $2,000 - $600 | $1,400 |
| Minus 50% of remainder | $1,400 × 50% | $700 |
| **Countable income** | — | **$700** |

This family has $700 countable income vs. $1,115 MAP (Region 1, non-exempt family of 3).
**Result:** Still eligible for cash aid AND Stage 1 childcare.

### What Income Counts?

| Counted | Not Counted |
|---------|-------------|
| Wages (after disregards) | First $600 of earnings |
| Self-employment (after expenses) | 50% of remaining earnings |
| Child support received | SNAP/CalFresh benefits |
| Unemployment benefits | Housing assistance |
| Social Security/SSI | One-time gifts |

## Family Fee Exemptions

You do NOT pay family fees if:

| Situation | Fee Status |
|-----------|------------|
| Receiving CalWORKs cash aid | **Exempt** |
| Income below 75% SMI | **Exempt** |
| Child in Child Protective Services | **Exempt** |
| CalFresh recipient (income-based) | **Often exempt** |

### 75% SMI Exemption Thresholds (2025-26)

| Family Size | Monthly 75% SMI |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | $6,053 |
| 3 | $6,869 |
| 4 | $7,959 |
| 5 | $9,232 |
| 6 | $10,505 |

*Families below these thresholds pay no family fees*

## Common Eligibility Questions

### Q: I make too much for cash aid. Can I still get childcare?
**A:** Not through CalWORKs. But you may qualify for:
- CCDF subsidies (up to 85% SMI)
- California State Preschool Program (up to 100% SMI)
- Head Start (at or below poverty level)

### Q: My income fluctuates month to month. How is it calculated?
**A:** For Stage 2/3, agencies average your income over the **previous 12 months** to smooth out fluctuations.

### Q: I got a raise. Will I lose my childcare?
**A:** Only if your income exceeds 85% SMI. The income disregards help protect you — a small raise doesn't usually push you over.

### Q: My child turns 13 next month. What happens?
**A:** Standard CalWORKs childcare ends at age 13. If your child has a documented disability, they may be eligible through age 21.
