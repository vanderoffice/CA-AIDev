## Detailed Eligibility Criteria

### Standard Eligibility (All Ages)

To qualify, your child must have a **developmental disability** that:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Originated before age 18** | Condition began during developmental period |
| **Expected to continue indefinitely** | Lifelong condition |
| **Causes substantial disability** | Significant limitations in 3+ major life areas |

### Qualifying Conditions

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Intellectual disability | Previously called mental retardation |
| Cerebral palsy | Motor impairment due to brain injury |
| Epilepsy | When it significantly impacts functioning |
| Autism spectrum disorder | Including Asperger's, PDD-NOS |
| Other similar conditions | Requiring treatment like intellectual disability |

### NOT Qualifying (By Themselves)

- Physical disabilities alone (without cognitive impact)
- Learning disabilities alone
- Mental health conditions alone (depression, anxiety, ADHD without other qualifying condition)
- Conditions that began after age 18

---

## The Seven Major Life Areas

"Substantial disability" means significant limitations in **3 or more** of these areas:

| Life Area | What It Means | Examples of Limitation |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Self-care** | Caring for basic needs | Cannot dress, feed, or toilet independently |
| **Receptive/expressive language** | Understanding and communicating | Significant speech delays, cannot follow instructions |
| **Learning** | Acquiring knowledge and skills | Cannot learn at typical pace, needs extensive support |
| **Mobility** | Moving and getting around | Cannot walk, needs wheelchair, unsafe without supervision |
| **Self-direction** | Managing daily life | Cannot make age-appropriate decisions, needs constant guidance |
| **Capacity for independent living** | Living skills | Cannot prepare food, manage household, live safely alone |
| **Economic self-sufficiency** | Working and managing money | Cannot hold employment, manage finances |

---

## Special Eligibility for Young Children

### Early Start (Birth to Age 3)

**Broader eligibility** — doesn't require full diagnosis. Children qualify if they have:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Developmental delay** | Behind in cognitive, communication, social, motor, or adaptive development |
| **Established risk condition** | Known condition with high probability of delay (Down syndrome, extreme prematurity, etc.) |
| **High biomedical risk** | Medical history suggesting significant risk of disability |

**Also eligible:** Parents at risk of having a child with developmental disability (genetic counseling).

### Provisional Eligibility (Ages 0-4)

Children ages 0-4 can qualify with limitations in only **2** life areas (instead of 3).

**Why this matters:** Formal diagnoses are often difficult to establish in very young children. Provisional eligibility allows access to services while diagnosis develops.

**No Early Start required:** A child can apply for provisional eligibility at ages 3-4 even if they weren't in Early Start before.

---

## What Doesn't Affect Eligibility

| Factor | Impact on Eligibility |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Income** | None — most services free regardless of income |
| **Immigration status** | None — only matters that child lives in CA |
| **Citizenship** | None — residency, not citizenship, required |
| **Insurance status** | None — Medi-Cal status affects fees, not eligibility |
| **Prior diagnosis** | Not required — Regional Center will assess |

### Residency Requirement

- Must live in California with intent to stay
- For children under 18: Residence = parents' residence
- Temporary absences okay if you plan to return
- Immigration status does NOT matter

---

## The Application Process

### Step 1: Contact Your Regional Center

**How to find yours:** [dds.ca.gov/rc/listings](https://www.dds.ca.gov/rc/listings/)

Call the main number and say:
> "I'd like to request an intake for my child. I believe they may have a developmental disability."

### Step 2: Initial Intake

**Timeline:** Within 15 working days of your request

**What happens:**
- Meet with Regional Center staff (may be phone or in-person)
- Provide basic information about your child
- Sign releases for the RC to obtain records
- RC decides whether to proceed with assessment

**What to bring/have ready:**
- Child's birth certificate
- Medical records and diagnoses
- School records and IEPs (if any)
- Contact information for doctors, therapists, teachers

### Step 3: Assessment

**Timeline:** Within 120 calendar days (60 days if urgent)

**Urgent = faster timeline if:**
- Delay would risk health or safety
- Delay would cause further developmental delay
- Child is at risk of more restrictive placement

**What happens during assessment:**
- Review of all records (medical, educational, psychological)
- Developmental testing
- Psychological evaluation
- Social assessment (family history, home situation)
- Interviews with parents and child

**No cost:** The assessment is FREE regardless of outcome.

### Step 4: Eligibility Determination

After assessment, the Regional Center determines:

| If Found Eligible | If Found Ineligible |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Assigned a service coordinator | Written notice of denial |
| Move to IPP development | Explanation of reasons |
| Access to services | Information about appeal rights |

**For children 0-4:** If not eligible under standard criteria, RC must also check provisional eligibility.

### Step 5: Individual Program Plan (IPP)

**Timeline:** Within 60 days of eligibility determination

**What it is:** A written plan that documents:
- Your child's goals and preferences
- Services and supports that will help
- Who provides each service
- How progress will be measured

**The IPP meeting:**
- You choose who attends (family, advocates, friends)
- Your child's goals drive the plan
- You must sign the IPP to agree
- Can be updated anytime needs change

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: My child doesn't have a formal diagnosis. Can I still apply?

**A:** Yes! The Regional Center will conduct assessments to determine eligibility. You don't need a pre-existing diagnosis.

### Q: Will this affect my immigration status?

**A:** No. Regional Center services are based on the child's residency, not citizenship. Immigration status is not considered and is not reported.

### Q: Do I need to pay for the assessment?

**A:** No. Assessment and eligibility determination are FREE for all applicants.

### Q: My child has autism but functions pretty well. Will they qualify?

**A:** It depends on whether they have "substantial disability" (limitations in 3+ life areas). Many children with autism do qualify, but it's assessed individually. Apply and let the RC assess.

### Q: Can my child get services while we wait for assessment?

**A:** Generally no, but if there's an urgent need (risk to health/safety), expedited assessment within 60 days is available. Ask specifically about "urgent intake."

### Q: What if I disagree with the assessment results?

**A:** You have the right to appeal. Request records, understand the reasons for denial, and file an appeal within 60 days.
