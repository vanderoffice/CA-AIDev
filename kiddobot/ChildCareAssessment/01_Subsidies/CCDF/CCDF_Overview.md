# California CCDF Child Care Subsidies Overview

**What is CCDF:** Child Care and Development Fund — federal block grant funding that California uses to provide subsidized childcare for low-income working families.

**Who it's for:** Working families with income up to 85% of State Median Income (SMI) who are NOT on CalWORKs cash aid.

**Key difference from CalWORKs:** No welfare-to-work requirement. You can access CCDF subsidies simply by being income-eligible and having a documented need for care.

## How CCDF Works in California

### Federal → State → Local Flow

```
FEDERAL (ACF/HHS)
    ↓ Block Grant
CALIFORNIA (CDSS + CDE)
    ↓ Contracts
LOCAL AGENCIES (APPs, R&Rs, Contractors)
    ↓ Services
FAMILIES + PROVIDERS
```

**CDSS** (Dept. of Social Services) administers voucher programs through Alternative Payment Programs (APPs).

**CDE** (Dept. of Education) administers the California State Preschool Program (CSPP).

### What CCDF Funds

| Program Type | Who Administers | How It Works |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Voucher subsidies** | APPs (70 statewide) | Family gets voucher → uses with any provider |
| **Direct contracts** | CDSS/CDE | State contracts directly with centers for slots |
| **CA State Preschool (CSPP)** | CDE | Part-day and full-day preschool for ages 3-5 |
| **General Child Care (CCTR)** | CDSS | Contract-based slots at centers |
| **Head Start coordination** | Multiple | Blended funding with federal Head Start |

## Provider Options

### Licensed Centers

- Meet Title 22 licensing standards (or Title 5 if state-subsidized)
- Professional staff, structured curriculum
- Best for: Families wanting school-readiness focus

### Family Child Care Homes (FCCHs)

- Small, in-home setting (6-14 children max)
- Often more flexible hours
- Best for: Infants/toddlers, non-traditional schedules

### License-Exempt Care (FFN)

- Relatives, friends, neighbors
- **TrustLine required** if not related by blood/marriage

## Eligibility Period

### 24-Month Certification

Once certified, you receive services for **24 months** without recertifying.

During this period:
- No need to report minor income changes
- Stability for your family and provider
- Only report if income exceeds ongoing eligibility threshold

### Recertification

At end of 24 months:
- APP contacts you for renewal
- Update income and need documentation
- If still eligible, continue services

---

## Waitlist Reality

### The Challenge

Demand exceeds supply in most California counties. Even with eligibility, you may wait:

| Priority Level | Typical Wait |
|----------------|--------------|
| CPS/At-Risk | Days to weeks |
| Low-income with need | Weeks to months |
| Moderate-income | Months to 1+ years |

### Strategies to Reduce Wait Time

1. **Apply to multiple programs:** APP waitlist + direct contractor waitlist + CSPP
2. **Update your file:** If income drops or circumstances change, report it
3. **Be flexible:** Consider FCCHs or FFN care while waiting for center slot
4. **Check Head Start:** Separate federal program with own enrollment
5. **Follow up regularly:** Call every 2-3 months to confirm active status
