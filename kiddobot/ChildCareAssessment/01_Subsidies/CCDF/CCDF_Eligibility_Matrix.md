## Common Eligibility Questions

### Q: My partner lives with us but isn't on the application. Does their income count?

**A:** Generally yes. If an unmarried partner lives in the household, their income is typically counted as part of the family's income, even if they're not the child's parent.

### Q: I'm self-employed and my income varies wildly. How is it calculated?

**A:** Agencies typically average your income over the **previous 12 months** to smooth fluctuations. Provide your tax return and a current P&L statement.

### Q: I got a raise. Will I lose my subsidy immediately?

**A:** Not necessarily. You only need to report if your income exceeds **85% SMI**. If you're still below that threshold, you remain eligible. The 24-month eligibility period provides stability.

### Q: My child turns 13 next month. What happens?

**A:** Standard CCDF eligibility ends at age 13. If your child has a documented disability and is receiving special education services, they may be eligible through age 21.

### Q: Can I use subsidies for overnight care? My job is at night.

**A:** Yes, with documentation of your work schedule. Licensed providers and license-exempt (FFN) providers can provide overnight care if authorized.
