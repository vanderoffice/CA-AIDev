## Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA)

### What Is It?

A DCFSA lets you pay for childcare with **pre-tax dollars**, reducing your taxable income.

### Key Details

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum contribution | $5,000/year (married filing jointly or single) |
| | $2,500 (married filing separately) |
| Tax savings | Saves ~25-35% depending on tax bracket |
| Enrollment | During open enrollment or qualifying event |
| Use-it-or-lose-it | Must use funds by end of plan year (some grace period) |

### How Much Can You Save?

| Childcare Expense | Without DCFSA | With DCFSA | Savings |
|-------------------|---------------|------------|---------|
| $5,000/year | Pay with after-tax dollars | Pay with pre-tax | ~$1,250-$1,750 |
| $10,000/year | $5,000 after-tax + $5,000 pre-tax | Mixed | ~$1,250-$1,750 |

*Savings vary by tax bracket. Higher income = higher savings.*

### Eligible Expenses

| Eligible | Not Eligible |
|----------|--------------|
| Daycare/preschool | Overnight camp |
| Babysitter/nanny | Tutoring |
| Before/after school care | School tuition (K-12) |
| Summer day camp | Food/clothing |
| Au pair (care portion) | Medical expenses |
| Household employee (care) | Transportation |

### Requirements

To use DCFSA funds, you must:
- Have earned income
- Use care for child under 13 (or disabled dependent)
- Use care to work or look for work
- Provider cannot be your dependent
- Claim the child on your taxes

### DCFSA vs. Tax Credit

You **cannot** use both DCFSA and the Child Care Tax Credit on the same expenses.

| Situation | Better Choice |
|-----------|---------------|
| Higher income (25%+ bracket) | DCFSA usually better |
| Lower income (lower bracket) | Tax credit may be better |
| Expenses > $5,000 | Use both (DCFSA up to $5K, credit on remainder) |

**Do the math:** Calculate your savings both ways or consult a tax advisor.

### How to Enroll

1. Check if your employer offers DCFSA (ask HR or benefits department)
2. Enroll during open enrollment (typically October-November)
3. Estimate your annual childcare costs
4. Elect your contribution amount
5. Submit claims throughout the year for reimbursement

## On-Site or Near-Site Childcare

### What It Is

Some employers operate or partner with childcare centers at or near the workplace.

### When to Use Backup Care

## Flexible Work Arrangements

### How Flexibility Helps with Childcare

| Compressed week | Fewer days needing care |

### Negotiating for Flexibility

**When discussing with employer:**
1. Propose specific arrangements (not just "flexibility")
2. Explain how you'll maintain productivity
3. Offer a trial period
4. Document the arrangement in writing

**Script example:**
> "I'd like to discuss a flexible schedule to better manage childcare. I'm proposing [specific arrangement]. Here's how I'll ensure my work is covered..."

> - Dependent Care FSA
> - Backup care programs
> - Childcare referral services
> - Flexible work arrangements
>
> If these aren't currently offered, I'd be happy to discuss how such benefits might support employee retention and productivity.
>
> Thank you,
> [Your name]

### Alternatives If No Employer Benefits
