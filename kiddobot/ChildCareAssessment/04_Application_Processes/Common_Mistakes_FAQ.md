## Mistake #1: Incomplete Documentation

### The Problem

The most common reason applications are delayed or denied is missing paperwork. Agencies require specific documents and cannot process incomplete applications.

### Common Documentation Errors

| Error | Result | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Missing pay stubs | Application returned | Submit 4 most recent consecutive pay stubs |
| Old tax return | Delays | Use most recent year's return |
| No birth certificate | Cannot verify age | Order from county vital records |
| Unsigned forms | Automatic rejection | Sign ALL pages requiring signature |
| Wrong immunization form | Enrollment delayed | Get CDPH 286 (blue card) from doctor |

### How to Avoid It

**Before submitting, check:**
- [ ] Every required document is attached
- [ ] All forms are signed and dated
- [ ] Documents are legible (not blurry photos)
- [ ] Names match exactly across all documents
- [ ] Dates are current (recent pay stubs, not old ones)

**Pro tip:** Make copies of everything before submitting. You may need them for renewal.

## Mistake #2: Income Calculation Errors

### The Problem

Families often miscalculate their income, leading to:
- Thinking they don't qualify (when they do)
- Getting approved, then losing eligibility at recertification
- Improper payment adjustments after the fact

### What Counts as Income?

| COUNTS as Income | DOES NOT Count |
|------------------|----------------|
| Wages & salaries | CalFresh/SNAP benefits |
| Self-employment net income | WIC benefits |
| Unemployment benefits | Housing assistance |
| Social Security | One-time lump sums |
| Child support received | Student loans/grants |
| Alimony | EITC refunds |
| Tips and commissions | Non-cash gifts |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Using net income | Programs use gross (before taxes) | Report gross monthly income |
| Forgetting irregular income | Overtime, bonuses count | Include all income sources |
| Wrong household size | Affects income limits | Count all children in your home |
| Not reporting income changes | Can cause overpayment | Report within 5 days |

### Income Limit Quick Reference

**2025 Income Eligibility (100% State Median Income for CSPP/APP)**

| Family Size | Monthly Gross | Annual |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 2 | $6,096 | $73,150 |
| 3 | $7,525 | $90,300 |
| 4 | $9,042 | $108,500 |
| 5 | $10,488 | $125,850 |

*Note: Head Start uses Federal Poverty Level (much lower). CalWORKs Stage 1 follows cash aid eligibility.*

## Mistake #3: Applying to the Wrong Program

### The Problem

California has multiple childcare subsidy programs with different eligibility rules. Applying to the wrong one wastes time.

### Program Selection Guide

```
START HERE: What's your situation?
                    │
        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
        ↓                       ↓
  Receiving CalWORKs?    Just need help
  (Cash aid)             paying for childcare?
        │                       │
        ↓                       │
  → CalWORKs Stage 1      ┌────┴────┐
    (Apply through        ↓         ↓
     welfare office)   Income    Income above
                       <100% FPL  100% FPL
                          │            │
                          ↓            ↓
                    → Head Start   → CSPP or APP
                    → CSPP           (Contact local
                                      CCR&R)
```

### Common Program Confusion

| If You Applied To... | But You Should Have Applied To... | Why |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----|
| APP | CalWORKs Stage 1 | On cash aid? Stage 1 is automatic |
| Head Start | CSPP | Income above FPL but under SMI? CSPP has higher limits |
| CSPP | Head Start | Want comprehensive services (health, dental)? Try Head Start |
| CalWORKs Stage 2 | CalWORKs Stage 1 | Still on cash aid? Stay in Stage 1 |

### The Right Contact

| Program | Who to Contact |
|---------|----------------|
| CalWORKs Stages 1-3 | County welfare office |
| CSPP | Local school district or CDE contractor |
| APP | Local CCR&R (rrnetwork.org) |
| Head Start | Local Head Start grantee (headstartca.org) |

---

## Mistake #4: Missing Deadlines

### The Problem

Missing critical deadlines can result in:
- Lost enrollment slots
- Service termination
- Waitlist removal
- Having to reapply from scratch

### Key Deadlines to Track

| Deadline Type | Timeframe | Consequence of Missing |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Initial application | Varies by program | Back of waitlist |
| Document submission | Usually 30 days | Application closed |
| Recertification | Annually, 12-month mark | Service termination |
| Income change reporting | Within 5 days | Overpayment liability |
| Provider change | Before starting new provider | No reimbursement |

### Annual Recertification

**You must recertify every 12 months.** Most families lose subsidies because they:
- Don't respond to the recertification notice
- Submit documents late
- Don't update contact information and miss the notice

### How to Avoid Missing Deadlines

1. **Mark your calendar** for 11 months after enrollment
2. **Update your contact info** immediately when it changes
3. **Respond quickly** to any agency mail
4. **Keep copies** of everything you submit

## Mistake #5: Choosing an Ineligible Provider

### The Problem

Not all childcare providers accept subsidies, and not all are eligible for every program.

### Provider Eligibility by Program

| Program | Licensed Centers | Licensed FCC | License-Exempt (FFN) |
|---------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| CalWORKs Stage 1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (TrustLine required) |
| CalWORKs Stage 2 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (TrustLine required) |
| CalWORKs Stage 3 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (TrustLine required) |
| APP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (TrustLine required) |
| CSPP | ✅ (contracted) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Head Start | ✅ (grantee-run) | Some | ❌ |

### Common Provider Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Provider not TrustLine registered | FFN care won't be paid | Provider must apply at trustline.org |
| Provider doesn't accept subsidies | They can refuse | Ask before enrolling |
| Provider license expired | Not eligible | Check at ccld.dss.ca.gov |
| Using relative without TrustLine | Payment denied | Relative needs background check |

### Before Choosing a Provider

1. **Ask:** "Do you accept [program name] subsidies?"
2. **Verify:** Check license at ccld.dss.ca.gov
3. **Confirm:** Provider agrees to the reimbursement rate
4. **For FFN:** Ensure they'll complete TrustLine registration

## Mistake #6: Not Reporting Changes

### The Problem

Failing to report changes can lead to:
- Overpayments you must repay
- Underpayments (you miss out on more help)
- Loss of eligibility
- Fraud allegations in serious cases

### What You Must Report (Within 5 Days)

| Change | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Income increase/decrease | Affects eligibility and family fee |
| Job loss or new job | Affects "need" qualification |
| Change in work schedule | Affects authorized care hours |
| Address change | May change your APP contractor |
| Family size change | Affects income limits and fees |
| Provider change | Need authorization for new provider |
| Child leaving care | Can't bill for child not in care |

### How to Report Changes

1. **Contact your APP contractor** or program office
2. **Submit in writing** (email is fine, keep proof)
3. **Provide documentation** (new pay stubs, address proof)
4. **Get confirmation** that change was received

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Eligibility Questions

**Q: Can I get help if I work part-time?**
A: Yes! Part-time work qualifies. You need to be working, in job training, or seeking employment. There's no minimum hours requirement for most programs.

**Q: What if I have no income?**
A: You may still qualify if you're:
- Looking for work
- In school or job training
- Receiving CalWORKs
- Experiencing homelessness
- A teen parent in school

**Q: Do I qualify if my child has two households?**
A: Eligibility is based on the household where the child lives most. If custody is 50/50, it's typically the parent who applies. Both parents cannot receive subsidies for the same child for the same hours.

**Q: Can undocumented parents apply?**
A: The child must be a U.S. citizen, national, or qualified immigrant. Parent immigration status is generally not asked for state programs, but verify with your local agency.

**Q: Does child support count as income?**
A: Yes, child support received counts as income. Child support you pay can sometimes be deducted.

### Application Process Questions

**Q: How long does approval take?**
A: Varies significantly:
- CalWORKs Stage 1: 1-2 weeks (tied to cash aid)
- APP: 2-4 weeks if slot available
- CSPP: Variable (enrollment periods)
- Head Start: 2-6 weeks

**Q: What if I'm on a waitlist?**
A:
- Call monthly to confirm you're still on the list
- Update your contact information
- Report any changes that might affect priority (homelessness, foster care, etc.)
- Apply to multiple programs simultaneously

**Q: Can I apply to multiple programs at once?**
A: Yes! Apply to every program you might qualify for. Accept the first approval, but you can switch if a preferred program opens up.

**Q: What if I'm denied?**
A:
1. Request the reason in writing
2. Check if it's an error you can correct
3. Ask about the appeal process
4. Contact your local CCR&R for help

---

### Provider Questions

**Q: Can a family member be my provider?**
A: Yes, in most programs (not CSPP/Head Start). Requirements:
- Cannot live in your home
- Must be 18+ years old
- Must pass TrustLine background check
- Cannot be the child's parent

**Q: Can I use an unlicensed provider?**
A: For CalWORKs and APP, yes—but they must register with TrustLine (background check). Head Start and CSPP require licensed or contracted providers only.

**Q: What if my provider raises their rates?**
A: Subsidies pay up to the Regional Market Rate (RMR) ceiling. If your provider charges more, you pay the difference. You can:
- Negotiate with provider
- Switch providers
- Check if a different age group has higher rates

**Q: Can I use two providers?**
A: Yes, many families use:
- One provider for regular hours
- Another for evening/weekend
- Different providers for different children

Each needs separate authorization.

---

### Payment Questions

**Q: Do I have to pay anything?**
A: Depends on your income:
- Head Start: Always free
- CalWORKs Stage 1: Usually free
- CalWORKs Stage 2/3, APP, CSPP: Family fees based on income

**Q: How is the family fee calculated?**
A: Based on your gross monthly income and family size. Fees range from $0 to ~$500/month depending on income level.

**Q: What if I can't afford the family fee?**
A:
- Report income changes (fee may decrease)
- Request a fee waiver (some programs allow)
- Check if you qualify for a lower-fee program

**Q: Who gets paid—me or the provider?**
A: The provider is paid directly by the agency (or through the APP contractor). You pay only your family fee to the provider.

---

### Special Situations

**Q: What if I lose my job?**
A:
- Report immediately to your program
- You typically have 60-120 days of continued eligibility while job searching
- You may transition to a different CalWORKs stage
- Keep documentation of your job search

**Q: What if I become homeless?**
A:
- Notify your program—you may get priority status
- Homeless families are Priority 1 for enrollment
- You can self-declare homelessness (no proof required)
- Your address can be a shelter or "no fixed address"

**Q: What about summer care for school-age kids?**
A: Many subsidies cover year-round care. You may need:
- Different authorization for summer hours
- Different provider (summer camp vs. after-school)
- Updated work schedule documentation

**Q: My child has a disability—are there extra steps?**
A:
- Head Start reserves 10% of slots for children with disabilities (any income)
- Regional Center may provide separate childcare funding
- You may qualify for higher priority placement
- Bring any IEP/IFSP documentation to your application
