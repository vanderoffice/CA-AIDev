## The California Immunization Registry (CAIR)

### What It Is

CAIR is a secure, online database that stores immunization records for Californians of all ages.

### Benefits of CAIR

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Records stay safe** | Even if you lose your paper records |
| **Survives doctor changes** | Records persist across providers |
| **Easy access** | Digital records available on demand |
| **School verification** | Schools can check status directly |

### Getting Your Child's Records

1. **From your doctor:** Request a printout from their system
2. **From CAIR:** Request through your healthcare provider
3. **Digital Vaccine Record:** Visit [myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov)
4. **Previous schools:** Schools keep immunization records

### If You've Lost Your "Yellow Card"

The "yellow card" is the California Immunization Record parents receive. If lost:
1. Contact your child's doctor for records
2. Request records from previous doctors
3. Contact schools your child attended
4. Ask your county health department

## Conditional Enrollment

### What It Is

Children who don't have all required vaccines can sometimes enroll while catching up.

### Requirements for Conditional Enrollment

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Some vaccines received** | Must have started the series |
| **On schedule** | Must be on track for remaining doses |
| **Plan documented** | Written catch-up plan required |
| **Regular review** | School reviews progress every 30 days |

### The 30-Day Review

Schools with conditionally enrolled students must:
1. Review immunization status at least every 30 days
2. Inform parents of remaining doses needed
3. Update records as vaccines are received
4. Exclude students who don't make progress

### What Happens If Progress Stops

If a conditionally enrolled child doesn't receive due vaccines:
- School must notify parents
- Child may be excluded until compliant
- Exclusion continues until next dose received

## Medical Exemptions

### The 2021 Changes

California law changed how medical exemptions work:

| Old System | New System |
|------------|------------|
| Any doctor could write exemption | Must use CAIR-ME web system |
| Paper forms accepted | Electronic submission required |
| Less oversight | CDPH reviews all exemptions |

### Who Can Issue Medical Exemptions

- Licensed physicians (MD, DO)
- NOT nurse practitioners alone
- NOT physician assistants alone
- Physicians on probation for immunization issues are restricted

### When Exemptions Are Needed

Medical exemptions are valid only when:
- Child has contraindication to vaccine
- Child had severe reaction to previous dose
- Medical condition makes vaccination risky

### How the Process Works

1. Doctor evaluates child's medical condition
2. Doctor submits exemption through CAIR-ME system
3. CDPH may review exemption
4. If approved, exemption issued for specific vaccines
5. Exemption valid until child enters new grade span

### Grade Spans

Exemptions must be renewed when entering new grade spans:

| Grade Span | When New Exemption Needed |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Birth - Preschool | Initial exemption |
| TK/K - 6th grade | New exemption at entry |
| 7th - 12th grade | New exemption at 7th grade |

### CDPH Review

CDPH can review and revoke exemptions if:
- Exemption appears medically unjustified
- Pattern of inappropriate exemptions from doctor
- School has high exemption rate (over 5%)

Parents have 30 days to appeal a revocation.

## Personal Belief Exemptions

### Current Status

**Personal belief exemptions are NOT available for childcare or school in California.**

Senate Bill 277 (2015) eliminated personal belief exemptions. Only medical exemptions are accepted.

### Religious Exemptions

California does not offer religious exemptions for required childhood vaccines.

## Homeless Families: McKinney-Vento Protections

### Immediate Enrollment Required

Under the McKinney-Vento Act, homeless students must be enrolled immediately, even without immunization records.

### What This Means

| Protection | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **No delay for records** | Cannot delay enrollment while locating records |
| **Help finding records** | School must help locate previous records |
| **Conditional enrollment** | Automatic conditional enrollment allowed |
| **No exclusion** | Cannot exclude based on missing records |

### Why This Protection Exists

Families experiencing homelessness often:
- Cannot locate or keep paper records
- Have changed doctors frequently
- Moved between schools repeatedly
- Cannot easily obtain records from previous providers

Most homeless children have been previously vaccinated — records just need to be located.

---

## Step-by-Step: Preparing for Enrollment

### 1. Gather Current Records

- Find your child's immunization card (yellow card)
- Request records from current doctor
- Check CAIR for digital records

### 2. Check What's Needed

Compare your records to the requirements for your child's age:
- Count doses of each required vaccine
- Note dates administered
- Identify any missing vaccines

### 3. Schedule Catch-Up Vaccines

If vaccines are missing:
- Contact your child's doctor
- Visit a local health clinic
- Check community vaccination events

Many health departments offer free childhood vaccines.

### 4. Get Updated Documentation

After catch-up vaccines:
- Request updated immunization record
- Ensure CAIR is updated
- Get copies for your records

### 5. Submit to Childcare/School

Provide documentation to:
- Childcare center director
- School registrar
- Preschool administrator

## Common Questions

### Q: My child got chickenpox. Do they still need the varicella vaccine?

**A:** No. If your child had chickenpox disease (documented by a healthcare provider), this counts as immunity. Provide documentation of the disease history.

### Q: We just moved to California. What do we need?

**A:** Bring all immunization records from your previous state. California accepts vaccines given elsewhere. If records are missing, your doctor can check titers (blood test) to verify immunity.

### Q: My child had a reaction to a vaccine. Can they be exempted?

**A:** Possibly. If the reaction was serious (not just mild fever or soreness), consult with your doctor about a medical exemption through CAIR-ME.

### Q: Can I delay vaccines and spread them out?

**A:** You can discuss alternative schedules with your doctor, but your child may not be able to enroll in childcare until required vaccines are received. Conditional enrollment requires being on schedule.

### Q: What if my doctor won't give a medical exemption I think is warranted?

**A:** You can seek a second opinion from another physician. However, medical exemptions are only appropriate for genuine medical contraindications.
