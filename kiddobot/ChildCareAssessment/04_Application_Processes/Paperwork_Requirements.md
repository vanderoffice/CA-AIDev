## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: My employer won't give me a letter

**Solution:** You can sign a declaration under penalty of perjury stating that requesting documentation would harm your employment. The agency must accept this and estimate reasonable hours based on your description.

### Problem: I lost my child's birth certificate

**Solution:** Order a replacement from the county of birth. This takes 2-4 weeks. In the meantime:
- Hospital birth records may work temporarily
- Some programs allow enrollment pending receipt

### Problem: I'm self-employed and my income varies wildly

**Solution:** Agencies typically average your income over the previous 12 months. Provide:
- Last year's tax return
- Current year P&L statement
- Explanation of seasonal patterns

### Problem: I'm homeless and have no documents

**Solution:** McKinney-Vento Act protections apply:
- Immediate enrollment required
- Cannot require proof of residence
- Cannot require immunization records immediately
- Contact school/agency homeless liaison

### Problem: I share housing and bills are in someone else's name

**Solution:** Provide:
- Letter from householder confirming you live there
- Their ID and utility bill
- Your signed statement
