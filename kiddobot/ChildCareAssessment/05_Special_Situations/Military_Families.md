## California Civilian Childcare Subsidies

### You May Also Qualify

Military families can also access California's civilian subsidies:

| Program | Eligibility |
|---------|-------------|
| **APP subsidies** | Based on income (up to 85% SMI) |
| **CSPP** | Based on income (up to 100% SMI) |
| **Head Start** | Based on income (poverty level) |
| **TK** | All 4-year-olds (free, no income test) |

### Using Both Systems

**You generally cannot double-dip**, but you can:
- Use civilian subsidies while waiting for on-base care
- Choose civilian subsidies if off-base is more convenient
- Combine TK (free) with military-subsidized after-school care

### Income Considerations

Military pay includes:
- Base pay (counted as income)
- BAH (may or may not count — varies by program)
- BAS (often not counted)
- Special pays (usually counted)

**Ask each program** how they count military income.

## Transitioning Out of Military

### What Happens to Childcare
