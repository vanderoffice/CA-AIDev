## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to be a licensed foster parent to access foster care childcare?

**A:** For formal foster children placed by the county, the child's status matters more than your licensing. However, RFA approval opens more pathways and supports.

### Q: I'm a grandparent raising my grandchild informally. Can I get help?

**A:** Yes! Contact your local CCR&R about:
- APP subsidies (if income-eligible)
- Head Start (if income-eligible or receiving benefits)
- CSPP
- County support programs

If the child is formally placed by CPS, you may get Priority 1 status.

### Q: Can foster children use license-exempt (FFN) care?

**A:** This depends on the child's case plan and county policy. Some counties allow it; others require licensed care. Check with the social worker.

### Q: What if I'm caring for multiple foster children?

**A:** Each child can access services individually. You pay one family fee (if any) based on the child with the most hours.

### Q: Does the child's biological parent's income matter?

**A:** No. Foster children's eligibility is based on the child's status and the caregiver's situation, not the birth parent's income.
