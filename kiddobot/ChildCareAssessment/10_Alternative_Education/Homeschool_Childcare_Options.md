## Why Homeschool Families Need Childcare

Homeschooling doesn't mean a parent is always available. Common situations:

| Situation | Childcare Need |
|-----------|----------------|
| Parent works outside the home | Full or part-time care during work |
| Parent works from home | Supervision while parent works |
| Single parent household | Coverage during work/appointments |
| Parent has health issues | Respite and support |
| Enrichment and socialization | Activity-based care |
| Sibling age differences | Care for younger while teaching older |

## Types of Care for Homeschool Families

### 1. Traditional Licensed Childcare

**Licensed Centers**
- Can provide part-time or full-day care
- Usually have set schedules (morning or afternoon)
- May offer "drop-in" days at some facilities
- Accept subsidy payments

**Good for:** Families with consistent work schedules

**Challenges:**
- May require minimum days/week commitment
- Hours may not align with flexible homeschool schedule
- Less flexibility for field trips, varying schedules

### 2. Licensed Family Childcare (FCC)

**Small home-based settings (6-14 children)**
- Often more flexible on scheduling
- May accommodate part-time or varied schedules
- Personal relationship with provider
- Accept subsidy payments

**Good for:** Families needing flexibility, younger children

**How to find:** [MyChildCare.ca.gov](https://mychildcare.ca.gov) or local CCR&R

### 3. License-Exempt Care (FFN)

**Family, friends, or neighbors providing care**

| Provider Type | Requirements |
|---------------|--------------|
| Relative not in home | TrustLine registration for subsidies |
| Non-relative | TrustLine registration for subsidies |
| In your home (nanny) | TrustLine for subsidies |

**Benefits for homeschool families:**
- Maximum flexibility
- Can work around homeschool schedule
- May provide care in your home
- Can accompany on field trips

**How TrustLine works:**
1. Caregiver applies at [trustline.org](https://trustline.org)
2. Background check completed (2-4 weeks)
3. Once registered, can receive subsidy payments

### 4. Homeschool Co-operatives

**NOT childcare, but related resource**

Co-ops are parent-organized groups where:
- Parents rotate teaching responsibilities
- Children get social interaction
- Specialized subjects covered by skilled parents
- Costs shared among families

**Types of co-ops:**

| Type | Structure | Cost |
|------|-----------|------|
| Teaching co-op | Parents all teach | Free (time trade) |
| Enrichment co-op | Focus on activities/socialization | Low cost |
| Academic co-op | Structured classes, hired teachers | Moderate cost |
| Hybrid co-op | Mix of parent-led and hired | Varies |

**Finding co-ops:**
- Local homeschool Facebook groups
- [HSLDA Group Finder](https://hslda.org/group-finder)
- [HSC (Homeschool Association of CA)](https://hsc.org) events
- Meetup.com homeschool groups
- Library homeschool programs

### 5. Drop-In Care

**Occasional, as-needed childcare**

| Provider | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Drop-in centers | Pay by hour, no commitment |
| Gym childcare | Care while you exercise |
| Church programs | Some offer weekday programs |
| Parent's Night Out | Evening care at centers |

**Good for:** Occasional needs, appointments, respite

**Note:** Drop-in care usually not covered by subsidies.

### 6. Community Programs

**Programs that provide supervision and enrichment:**

| Program | Ages | Cost | Hours |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Parks & Recreation classes | Varies | Low | Part-time |
| YMCA/YWCA programs | All | Sliding scale | Varies |
| Boys & Girls Club | 6-18 | Low | After school |
| Library programs | All | Free | Limited hours |
| Museum homeschool days | All | Admission | Specific days |

## Using Subsidies for Homeschool Childcare

### Key Points

1. **Homeschooling itself is NOT a qualifying activity** for subsidies
2. **Work, job search, or training IS** a qualifying activity
3. Subsidies cover care **during qualifying activities**, not for homeschool time
4. Your homeschool status doesn't disqualify you

### What This Means in Practice

**Scenario:** You homeschool and work 30 hours/week

| Need | Covered by Subsidy? |
|------|---------------------|
| Care while you work | YES |
| Care so you can teach | NO |
| Care for both work + teaching | Only work hours |

### Subsidy-Eligible Care Arrangements

| Arrangement | Subsidy-Compatible? | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Licensed center | Yes | Must accept subsidies |
| Licensed FCC | Yes | Must accept subsidies |
| TrustLine relative | Yes | Can't live with you |
| TrustLine non-relative | Yes | Background check required |
| Drop-in care | Usually no | Most aren't set up for subsidies |
| Co-ops | No | Not childcare |
| Parent exchange | No | No payment involved |

### How to Apply for Subsidies

**Step 1:** Determine your qualifying activity
- Working (any hours)
- Job searching (time-limited)
- Training/education program
- CalWORKs Welfare-to-Work

**Step 2:** Gather documentation
- Proof of income
- Work schedule
- Child's age verification
- California residency

**Step 3:** Apply through appropriate program
- Working family: Contact local APP contractor
- CalWORKs: Through your county worker
- Very low income: Apply for CSPP (California State Preschool)

**Step 4:** Find a provider who accepts subsidies
- Use [MyChildCare.ca.gov](https://mychildcare.ca.gov)
- Call your CCR&R for referrals
- Ask providers directly

## Creative Arrangements for Homeschool Families

### The "Swap" Model

Trade childcare with another homeschool family:
- You watch their kids Tuesday/Thursday
- They watch yours Monday/Wednesday/Friday
- Both can work or teach during "off" time

**Note:** No payment = no subsidy eligibility for this portion

### The "Cluster" Model

Group of homeschool families share a caregiver:
- Hire one person to supervise all kids
- Split cost among families
- Kids get socialization
- Parents get work/teaching time

**Subsidy consideration:** Each family may be able to use their subsidy toward their share

### The "Shift" Model

Stagger work and homeschool:
- Morning: One parent works, other teaches
- Afternoon: Switch roles
- Result: Less childcare needed

### The "Enrichment" Model

Use community programs strategically:
- Morning: Homeschool academics
- Afternoon: Child in Parks & Rec, sports, or classes
- Parent works during enrichment time

## Finding Homeschool-Friendly Providers

### Questions to Ask Providers

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Do you accept part-time enrollment? | Homeschoolers often need fewer hours |
| Can hours vary week to week? | Flexibility for field trips, appointments |
| Do you accept subsidies? | If you qualify |
| What's your schedule flexibility? | For varying homeschool needs |
| Are children at different levels together? | Mixed-age is normal for homeschool |
| Can you accommodate field trip days? | Important for homeschool families |

### Green Flags

- Experience with homeschool families
- Flexible scheduling options
- Part-time availability
- Understanding of varied schedules
- Willing to coordinate with your educational approach

### Red Flags

- Rigid full-time only requirement
- No understanding of homeschool context
- Unwilling to accommodate schedule changes
- Negative attitude toward homeschooling

## Special Situations

### Single Parents Homeschooling

**Challenge:** Need income AND teaching time

**Solutions:**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Work from home + FCC | Subsidized FCC during work; teach evenings/weekends |
| Night shift + co-op | Work nights; co-op provides daytime support |
| Part-time work + virtual school | Virtual academy handles instruction; work part-time |
| Family care sharing | Relatives provide some care |

**Subsidy tip:** Even part-time work qualifies for subsidies proportional to hours worked.

### Multiple Children, Different Ages

**Challenge:** Need care for younger while teaching older (or vice versa)

**Solutions:**
- FFN care for youngest during teaching time (not subsidized unless you're working)
- Structured independent work for older kids while caring for younger
- Co-op where older kids participate while you supervise younger
- Part-time preschool for youngest (CSPP is free if income-eligible)

### Child with Special Needs

Regional Center services continue regardless of homeschool status:
- Therapies (speech, OT, PT) can happen during homeschool day
- Respite care may be available through Regional Center
- Specialized childcare can be funded through your IPP/IFSP
