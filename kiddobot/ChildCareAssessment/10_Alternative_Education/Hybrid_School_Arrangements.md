# Hybrid School Arrangements

**Purpose:** Understand options that combine homeschooling with traditional schooling, and how childcare fits into these mixed models.

---

## What Is Hybrid Schooling?

Hybrid schooling combines elements of home education with formal school attendance. Your child might:
- Attend school part-time and learn at home part-time
- Take some subjects at school and others at home
- Use an online school with periodic in-person components
- Participate in school activities while homeschooling academically

## Types of Hybrid Arrangements in California

### 1. Part-Time Public School Enrollment

**How it works:** Child enrolls in public school for specific classes or days, not full-time.

| Variation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Subject-specific | Enrolled for math, science, or electives only |
| Partial days | Attend mornings only, homeschool afternoons |
| Partial week | Attend 2-3 days, homeschool others |
| Activities only | Homeschool academics, attend for sports/arts |

**California law:** Public schools *may* allow part-time enrollment but are **not required** to accept homeschooled students part-time. Policies vary by district.

**How to pursue:**
1. Contact your local school district's enrollment office
2. Ask specifically about part-time enrollment options
3. If denied, ask about "shared time" or "dual enrollment" policies
4. Consider charter school alternatives (see below)

### 2. Independent Study Programs (Public)

**How it works:** Your child is officially enrolled in public school but studies at home with periodic teacher meetings.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Enrollment status | Public school student |
| Curriculum | Usually provided by school |
| Oversight | Credentialed teacher assigned |
| Accountability | Regular work samples, meetings |
| Cost | Free (public school) |

**Benefits:**
- Free curriculum and materials
- Teacher support and guidance
- Child counts for school funding
- Access to school activities (varies by program)
- May qualify for school-based childcare

**Limitations:**
- Less curriculum flexibility than pure homeschool
- Must meet school's requirements
- Regular meetings and check-ins required

**How to enroll:**
1. Contact your district about Independent Study Program (ISP)
2. Review their curriculum and requirements
3. Sign a Master Agreement
4. Meet with assigned teacher regularly

### 3. Charter School Homeschool Programs

**How it works:** Enroll in a charter school designed for home-based learning.

| Program Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Non-classroom-based** | Learn at home, periodic meetings |
| **Hybrid charter** | Some days at learning center, some at home |
| **Resource centers** | Optional classes/activities available |

**Popular California Options:**

| Charter | Model | Features |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **California Virtual Academies (CAVA)** | Online + occasional meetups | K-12, full curriculum online |
| **Connections Academy** | Online + learning coach | Flexible pacing |
| **Inspire Charter** | Funds for curriculum + activities | Parent-directed |
| **iLEAD** | Project-based + home study | Creative approach |
| **Sky Mountain** | Waldorf-inspired home study | Arts-integrated |
| **Sage Oak** | Personalized learning fund | Family chooses curriculum |

**Funding benefits:** Many charter homeschool programs provide:
- Free curriculum
- Funds for enrichment activities ($2,000-3,000/year typical)
- Access to learning centers
- Field trips and group activities

**Childcare consideration:** Children enrolled in these programs are "public school students" which may affect childcare subsidy eligibility differently than pure homeschoolers.

### 4. Private School Satellite Programs (PSP)

**How it works:** Enroll in a private school that oversees your homeschooling.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Legal status | Private school student |
| Curriculum | Varies by PSP (some provide, some don't) |
| Oversight | Private school provides varying levels |
| Cost | Usually $200-1,500/year |

**Types of PSPs:**

| Type | Support Level | Cost | Who It's For |
|------|---------------|------|--------------|
| Filing-only | Minimal (just paperwork) | Low | Experienced homeschoolers |
| Advisory | Guidance available | Medium | Want some support |
| Full-service | Classes, curriculum, activities | Higher | Want community |

**How to find PSPs:**
- [HomeSchool Association of California (HSC)](https://hsc.org)
- [CHEA of California](https://californiahomeschool.net)
- Local homeschool groups

### 5. Microschools and Learning Pods

**How it works:** Small groups of students learn together, often in a home setting.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Learning pod** | Families share teaching/supervision |
| **Microschool** | Small school (5-15 students) often in home |
| **Forest school** | Outdoor-based, nature education |
| **Homeschool hybrid school** | 2-3 days at school, rest at home |

**Growing trend since 2020.** These can be:
- Parent-run (families rotate teaching)
- Teacher-run (hired instructor for small group)
- Hybrid (mix of both)

**Childcare implications:** If your child attends a microschool/pod, that time may count as childcare if:
- The program involves paid supervision
- It's a licensed facility
- It has a TrustLine-registered caregiver

## How Hybrid Arrangements Affect Childcare

### School Enrollment Status Matters

| Status | How Subsidy Programs View Child |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Public school enrolled (full or part-time) | School-age, eligible for before/after care |
| Charter home study | Usually school-age, similar to public |
| Private school (PSP) | School-age |
| Pure homeschool (PSA) | Not enrolled, full-time eligible |

### Care Needs by Arrangement

| Arrangement | Typical Care Needs |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Part-time public school | Care during non-school hours |
| Independent study | Care during parent's work hours |
| Charter hybrid | Care on non-school days + before/after |
| Full homeschool | Care during all work hours |

### Subsidy Implications

**Key principle:** Subsidies are based on **your work schedule**, not your child's school schedule.

**Example scenarios:**

| Scenario | Subsidy Coverage |
|----------|------------------|
| Work 40 hrs, child in hybrid (school 3 days) | Care authorized for work hours on non-school days + before/after on school days |
| Work 30 hrs, child in online charter | Care authorized for 30 hrs during your work time |
| Work 20 hrs, pure homeschool | Care authorized for 20 hrs during your work time |

## Childcare Programs for Hybrid Students

### Before/After School Programs

If your child attends school part-time, they may qualify for:

| Program | Eligibility | Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **ASES (After School Education & Safety)** | Public school students | Free |
| **21st Century CCLC** | Title I schools | Free |
| **School-based care** | Enrolled students | Varies |
| **Boys & Girls Club** | Any child | Low cost |
| **YMCA** | Any child | Sliding scale |

**Note:** These programs typically require school enrollment. Pure homeschoolers may not qualify.

### Care for Non-School Days

If child attends 2-3 days/week, you need care for other days:

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Licensed childcare | Part-time enrollment may be available |
| Family childcare | Often more flexible on schedule |
| FFN care | Most flexible |
| Drop-in care | For occasional needs |

---

## Coordinating Multiple Programs

### Example: Hybrid Charter + Subsidized Care

**Situation:**
- Child enrolled in charter that meets Tuesday/Thursday
- Parent works Monday-Friday
- Family income qualifies for subsidies

**Solution:**
```
Monday      | Subsidized FCC (full day)
Tuesday     | Charter school + subsidized before/after care
Wednesday   | Subsidized FCC (full day)
Thursday    | Charter school + subsidized before/after care
Friday      | Subsidized FCC (full day)
```

### Example: Independent Study + Part-Time Work

**Situation:**
- Child in district Independent Study program
- Parent works part-time (20 hrs/week)
- Need care during work hours

**Solution:**
- Contact APP for subsidized care during work hours
- Independent Study meetings scheduled around work
- Child does schoolwork during care (supervised)

### Example: Microschool + Parent Work-from-Home

**Situation:**
- Child attends microschool 3 mornings/week
- Parent works from home full-time
- Need afternoon supervision

**Solution:**
- Microschool covers morning supervision
- Afternoon: FFN caregiver (could be TrustLine registered for subsidies)
- Flexibility for parent to work while child is supervised

### Documentation to Maintain

| Document | Why You Need It |
|----------|-----------------|
| School enrollment verification | Proves status for subsidy/programs |
| Attendance records | Shows actual care needs |
| Work schedule | Determines authorized care hours |
| Transportation arrangements | How child gets between locations |
| Emergency contacts | For all programs involved |

### Communication Plan

When child is in multiple programs:
1. **Share schedules** with all providers
2. **Coordinate pickup/dropoff** logistics
3. **Establish communication** method for changes
4. **Create backup plans** for schedule conflicts
