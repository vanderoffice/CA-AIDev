## Key Points

### Homeschool Status and Subsidies

- **Homeschooling itself is NOT a qualifying activity** for childcare subsidies
- **Work, job search, or training IS** a qualifying activity
- Homeschool status doesn't disqualify you from subsidies—it's neutral
- Subsidies cover care during your qualifying activity hours

### School Enrollment Status Matters

| Status | Subsidy View |
|--------|--------------|
| Public school (full or part-time) | School-age child |
| Charter homeschool program | Usually treated as school-age |
| Private school satellite (PSP) | School-age |
| Pure homeschool (PSA filed) | Not enrolled—may affect hours |

### Common Scenarios

| Situation | Childcare Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Work full-time + homeschool | Subsidized care during work; teach before/after |
| Work part-time + homeschool | Subsidized care during work hours only |
| Single parent + homeschool | FFN care, co-ops, virtual academy support |
| Hybrid arrangement | Mix of school programs + subsidized care for gaps |
