## Do Subsidies Cover Homeschool Families?

### Short Answer: Yes, With Caveats

Homeschool status doesn't disqualify you from childcare subsidies, but:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Work requirement** | Must be working/training for most subsidies |
| **"Approved activity"** | Homeschooling alone isn't a qualifying activity |
| **Hours authorized** | Based on work/training hours, not education |

### How It Works

**Scenario:** Parent works 25 hours/week and homeschools

| Need | What Gets Covered |
|------|-------------------|
| Care during work hours | Yes, subsidized |
| Time for homeschooling | Not separately subsidized |
| Enrichment activities | May count as care if supervised |

### Subsidy Eligibility

You qualify if you meet standard requirements:
- Working, training, or seeking work
- Income under 85% SMI
- Child under 13 (or disabled)

**Homeschooling status itself is neutral** — it doesn't help or hurt eligibility.

## Finding "Childcare" for Homeschool Families

### What Homeschool Families Often Need

| Need | Options |
|------|---------|
| **Daytime supervision** | FFN care, licensed care during work |
| **Enrichment classes** | Co-ops, community programs, sports |
| **Social activities** | Homeschool groups, park days |
| **Tutoring** | Subject-specific help |
| **Respite** | Drop-in care, occasional sitters |

### Homeschool Co-operatives

Many homeschool families form co-ops where:
- Parents take turns teaching
- Children get social interaction
- Specialized subjects are covered
- Costs are shared

**Not childcare** but can supplement your arrangement.

### Community Programs

| Resource | What They Offer |
|----------|-----------------|
| Parks & Recreation | Classes, camps, sports |
| YMCA/YWCA | Youth programs, homeschool PE |
| Museums | Homeschool days, educational programs |
| Libraries | Programs, resources, social events |
| Sports leagues | Teams, activities |

## Combining Approaches

### Hybrid Schooling

Some families combine homeschool with part-time school:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Part-time enrollment** | Child attends school part of the week |
| **Subject-specific** | Math at school, other subjects at home |
| **Dual enrollment** | High schooler takes community college classes |
| **Enrichment only** | Home academics + school sports/arts |

### California Virtual Academies

Free public charter schools offering:
- Online curriculum
- Credentialed teacher support
