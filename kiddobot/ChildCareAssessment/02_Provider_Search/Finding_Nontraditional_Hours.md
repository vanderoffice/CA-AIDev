# Finding Childcare for Nontraditional Hours

**Purpose:** Resources for parents who need care outside typical 9-5 schedules.

---

## The Challenge

Most licensed childcare centers operate Monday–Friday, roughly 6 AM–6 PM. But many parents work:

- Evening shifts (hospitality, healthcare, retail)
- Night shifts (nursing, security, manufacturing)
- Weekends (service industry, emergency responders)
- Rotating or variable schedules
- On-call positions

Finding care for these hours is significantly harder than daytime care.

## Your Options

| Option | Hours Available | Regulation | Cost Level |
|--------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Extended-hour centers** | 6 AM–9 PM or later | Licensed | $$–$$$ |
| **24-hour child care** | Around the clock | Licensed | $$$–$$$$ |
| **Family child care homes** | Often more flexible | Licensed | $$–$$$ |
| **License-exempt (FFN)** | Any hours agreed | TrustLine optional | $–$$ |
| **Nannies/babysitters** | Any hours agreed | TrustLine recommended | $$–$$$$ |
| **Emergency/crisis care** | Varies | Often licensed | Free–$$ |

## Extended-Hour Licensed Centers

### What They Offer

Some licensed centers operate beyond typical hours:
- Early morning drop-off (5 AM or earlier)
- Evening pickup (8 PM or later)
- Saturday care
- Holiday coverage

### How to Find Them

1. **Contact your local CCR&R agency**
   - Specify your schedule needs
   - Ask for providers offering extended hours
   - [rrnetwork.org](https://rrnetwork.org/about/r-r-directory)

2. **Search MyChildCarePlan.org**
   - Filter by hours of operation
   - Note: not all providers list extended hours online
   - Call promising providers directly

3. **Ask your employer**
   - Some employers partner with childcare providers
   - Hospital systems often have on-site or affiliated childcare
   - Large employers may offer backup care benefits

### Questions to Ask

```
□ What are your exact hours of operation?
□ Do you offer early drop-off or late pickup?
□ Is there an extra fee for extended hours?
□ What happens if I'm late for pickup?
□ Do you require minimum attendance days?
```

## 24-Hour Child Care Centers

### What They Are

Licensed facilities that provide continuous care, including overnight stays when needed.

### How They Work

- Function as normal daycare during the day
- Children can stay overnight as needed
- Separate sleeping areas for overnight care
- Staff trained for both day and night routines

### Reality Check

**24-hour centers are rare in California.** Most families needing overnight care use:
- Family child care homes (more common for flexible hours)
- License-exempt providers (nannies, relatives)
- Rotating schedules with co-parents

### Where They Exist

24-hour childcare is more common in areas with:
- Major hospitals/medical centers
- Military bases
- Large manufacturing facilities
- Casino/gaming industries

Contact your local CCR&R to ask if any exist in your area.

## Family Child Care Homes

### Why They're Often More Flexible

- Single provider sets their own hours
- Home-based setting accommodates varied schedules
- May offer evening, overnight, or weekend care
- Often willing to work with nontraditional schedules

### What to Look For

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Provider's own schedule** | Some providers are night owls or early risers |
| **Backup arrangements** | Who covers if the provider is ill? |
| **Sleeping arrangements** | Safe sleep space for overnight care |
| **Other children's schedules** | Does the provider serve multiple families with different hours? |

### How to Find Flexible Family Child Care

1. Be specific with your CCR&R about your hours
2. Search by location AND hours needed
3. Call providers directly — many don't advertise flexibility online
4. Network with other parents who work similar schedules

---

## License-Exempt Options

### When License-Exempt Care Makes Sense

For truly nontraditional schedules, license-exempt care may be your best option:

| Provider Type | Best For |
|--------------|----------|
| **Nanny** | Full-time nontraditional, variable hours |
| **Babysitter** | Part-time or occasional irregular hours |
| **Relatives** | Any schedule; built-in trust |
| **Family friend/neighbor** | Known caregiver, flexibility |

### Using Subsidies for FFN Care

If you receive childcare subsidies, you CAN use them with license-exempt providers:
- Provider must register with TrustLine
- Provider must pass background check
- County APP administers the arrangement
- Rates may be lower than licensed care

### Finding Quality FFN Care

1. **Ask your network** — Other parents, community groups, faith organizations
2. **Check TrustLine** — Verify or request background checks
3. **Create clear agreements** — Hours, pay, responsibilities, backup plans
4. **Consider shared care** — Two families sharing one caregiver

## Night Childcare

### The Reality

Night childcare (sleeping overnight) options are limited:

| Option | Availability | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| 24-hour centers | Rare | Contact CCR&R to find |
| Family child care | Some providers | Ask specifically about overnight |
| Nanny | Common for night shifts | Higher pay for overnight |
| Relatives | Depends on family | Often most practical |

### Average Night Care Costs (2024-2025)

- **Nanny/babysitter (overnight):** $20–35/hour or flat rate
- **Family child care (overnight):** $100–200/night
- **24-hour center (if available):** Similar to extended-day rates

### Safety Considerations for Overnight Care

```
□ Safe sleep environment (crib, pack-n-play for infants)
□ Provider awake and monitoring? Or sleeping nearby?
□ What happens if child wakes or is sick?
□ Emergency contact procedures
□ Morning routine and handoff process
```

---

## Weekend Childcare

### Saturday Care

More available than other nontraditional hours:
- Some licensed centers offer Saturday
- Many family child care providers work Saturdays
- School-age programs may have Saturday enrichment

### Sunday Care

Harder to find:
- Few licensed programs operate Sunday
- Family child care or FFN usually needed
- Consider faith-based programs with Sunday school

### How to Find Weekend Care

1. **CCR&R search** — Specify weekend needs
2. **Employer resources** — Some workplaces partner with weekend providers
3. **Parent networks** — Weekend-working parents often share solutions
4. **Care.com or Sittercity** — Search for weekend availability

## Sick Child Care

### When Your Child Is Too Sick for Regular Care

Most childcare programs exclude children who are:
- Feverish (100.4°F+ typically)
- Vomiting or having diarrhea
- Contagious (chickenpox, strep, etc.)
- Too ill to participate in activities

### Your Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mildly ill childcare** | Some programs accept children with minor illness |
| **Backup care programs** | Employer benefits may cover sick child care |
| **In-home sick care** | Agencies sending caregivers to your home |
| **Family/FFN** | Relatives or trusted caregivers |

### Finding Mildly Ill Care

This is rare but exists in some areas:
- Hospital-affiliated childcare programs
- Specialized sick child care centers
- Ask your CCR&R

## Building a Nontraditional Hours Strategy

### Step 1: Map Your Actual Needs

```
Monday:    ___AM to ___PM
Tuesday:   ___AM to ___PM
Wednesday: ___AM to ___PM
Thursday:  ___AM to ___PM
Friday:    ___AM to ___PM
Saturday:  ___AM to ___PM
Sunday:    ___AM to ___PM

Variable/On-call hours: _______________________
Travel requirements: _________________________
```

### Step 2: Identify Your Options

| Need | Primary Option | Backup Option |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Early morning | | |
| Daytime | | |
| Evening | | |
| Overnight | | |
| Weekend | | |
| Emergencies | | |

### Step 3: Build Redundancy

No single solution works for every situation. Build a network:

1. **Primary care** — Your regular childcare arrangement
2. **Backup care** — For when primary isn't available
3. **Emergency contacts** — Family/friends for last-minute needs
4. **Employer benefits** — Know what's available before you need it

### Step 4: Communicate Clearly

With any provider:
- Be upfront about your schedule (including variability)
- Discuss backup scenarios
- Create clear agreements about extra hours/costs
- Maintain open communication about changes

## Subsidy Considerations for Nontraditional Hours

### Subsidies CAN Cover Nontraditional Care

If you qualify for CalWORKs or CCDF subsidies:
- Coverage is based on your work/school schedule
- Extended hours and weekends can be covered
- Provider must meet program requirements

### Documentation for Variable Schedules

```
□ Employer letter stating variable/nontraditional hours
□ Work schedule (even if it changes)
□ Declaration of hours if self-employed
□ Training/school schedule
```

### Finding Subsidy-Accepting Providers with Flexible Hours

1. Ask your APP (Alternative Payment Program) specifically
2. Be clear about your exact schedule needs
3. Some APPs maintain lists of providers with extended hours
4. FFN providers can accept subsidies with TrustLine registration
