**Purpose:** Guide for families with children who have developmental disabilities, medical needs, or require specialized care.

## Your Child's Right to Inclusive Care

### The Law Protects Your Child

Under federal law (Americans with Disabilities Act), childcare providers cannot:

- ❌ Refuse to enroll a child because of disability
- ❌ Charge higher fees because of disability
- ❌ Exclude a child from activities due to disability
- ❌ Fail to make reasonable accommodations

**This applies to:**
- Licensed child care centers
- Family child care homes
- School-based programs
- Most private programs open to the public

### What "Reasonable Accommodation" Means

Providers must make changes that don't cause "undue burden," such as:

- Modifying activities so all children can participate
- Adjusting schedules for therapy appointments
- Providing additional supervision as needed
- Training staff on child-specific needs
- Administering medication (with proper procedures)
- Working with therapists who visit the program

## Types of Specialized Care

| Care Type | Best For | How to Find |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Inclusive mainstream programs** | Children who can participate with accommodations | Any licensed program (must accommodate) |
| **Enhanced rate providers** | Children needing extra support (lower ratios) | Regional Center, CCR&R |
| **Specialized programs** | Children with significant needs | Regional Center, school district |
| **In-home care** | Children with medical or behavioral needs | Regional Center, private agencies |
| **Therapeutic childcare** | Children in therapy/treatment | Regional Center, health providers |

---

## Working with Regional Centers

### What Regional Centers Do for Childcare

If your child is Regional Center-eligible, your service coordinator can help:

- Identify inclusive childcare providers in your area
- Coordinate with childcare subsidy programs (CalWORKs, CCDF)
- Access enhanced reimbursement rates for specialized care
- Arrange for therapists to visit your child at childcare
- Train childcare providers on your child's needs
- Fund respite care so you can work

### Regional Center Services That Support Childcare

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Service coordination** | Help finding and arranging childcare |
| **Respite care** | Temporary care so parents can work or rest |
| **Behavioral services** | Behavior plans for childcare settings |
| **Early intervention** | Therapies that can occur at childcare |
| **Provider training** | Training childcare staff on disability needs |

### If Your Child Isn't Yet Regional Center-Eligible

You can still apply for Regional Center services while seeking childcare. Assessment is free and may qualify your child for additional support.

**See:** [Regional Center Eligibility & Application](../Regional_Center/Eligibility_and_Application.md)

## Finding Inclusive Programs

### Step 1: Start with Your Needs Assessment

```
□ What is my child's diagnosis/condition?
□ What accommodations does my child need?
□ Does my child receive therapies? How often?
□ Does my child have medical procedures (meds, feeding, etc.)?
□ What behaviors might challenge providers?
□ What supports help my child succeed?
□ What's my schedule and childcare hours needed?
```

### Step 2: Contact Your Local CCR&R

Child Care Resource & Referral agencies can:
- Refer you to providers experienced with special needs
- Identify programs with trained inclusion staff
- Connect you with subsidy programs
- Provide information on your rights

**Find yours:** [rrnetwork.org](https://rrnetwork.org/about/r-r-directory)

### Step 3: Ask About Inclusion

When contacting providers, ask:

```
□ Do you have experience with children with [condition]?
□ What training do your staff have in special needs?
□ How do you handle accommodations?
□ Can therapists visit during the day?
□ What is your ratio for children needing extra support?
□ Do you have an inclusion specialist on staff?
□ How do you work with Regional Centers?
□ Do you accept enhanced rate subsidies?
```

### Step 4: Coordinate with Your Care Team

If your child has a Regional Center service coordinator, therapists, or medical providers:
- Include them in childcare discussions
- Share relevant information with the provider (with consent)
- Develop consistent approaches across settings

---

## Enhanced Rate Providers

### What Enhanced Rates Are

Some childcare programs receive higher reimbursement rates for serving children with:
- Developmental disabilities
- Significant medical needs
- Behavioral challenges requiring extra supervision

**Why this matters:** Enhanced rates help providers afford:
- Additional staff for lower ratios
- Specialized training
- Equipment or modifications
- Extra time for care coordination

### How to Find Enhanced Rate Providers

1. **Regional Center** — Ask your service coordinator
2. **Your APP** — Ask if they maintain a list of enhanced rate providers
3. **CCR&R** — Ask specifically about programs for children with disabilities
4. **Head Start** — Required to serve children with disabilities (10% of enrollment)

### If a Provider Doesn't Currently Accept Enhanced Rates

They may be able to start. Your Regional Center or APP can explain the process.
