## Tips for Bay Area Families

### Maximize Employer Benefits First

1. Check for DCFSA ($5,000 pre-tax savings)
2. Ask about on-site care or employer subsidies
3. Look for backup care programs
4. Tech workers: your company may have more than you know

### Apply to Multiple Programs

1. Centralized Eligibility List in your county
2. Head Start (regardless of CEL status)
3. State Preschool directly with providers
4. SFUSD Preschool for All (SF residents)

### Consider Geographic Flexibility

If you can choose where to live:
- **Contra Costa** and **Alameda** generally have shorter waitlists
- **SF** has unique city-funded programs that may offset costs
- **South Bay** has strong employer benefits but longer public waitlists

### Use Quality Ratings

All Bay Area counties participate in Quality Counts California. Look for rated providers at [qualitycountsca.net](https://qualitycountsca.net).
