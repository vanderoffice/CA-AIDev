## Understanding County Differences

### Why Counties Vary

California childcare subsidies flow through different channels:
- **State funds** administered by county welfare departments
- **Federal funds** administered by APPs (Alternative Payment Programs)
- **Local funds** administered by cities, school districts, First 5

Each county has different:
- APP contractors (some have one, some have many)
- Waitlist management (centralized vs. fragmented)
- Cost of living (affects provider rates and family costs)
- Program availability (Head Start capacity, etc.)

### Region Classifications

California divides counties into regions for reimbursement purposes:

| Region | Cost Level | Example Counties |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Region 1 | Higher | LA, SF, Bay Area, San Diego, Orange |
| Region 2 | Moderate | Sacramento, Fresno, San Bernardino |
| Region 3 | Lower | Rural counties |

Region affects provider reimbursement rates but not family eligibility.
