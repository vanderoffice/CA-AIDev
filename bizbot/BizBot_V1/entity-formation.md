# Phase 1: Entity Formation

Complete this phase within the first 1-2 weeks. This establishes your legal business structure.

## Step 1: Choose Business Structure

**Sole Proprietorship**
- No registration required (use DBA if different name)
- Personal liability (not protected)
- Simplest but riskiest structure

**LLC (Limited Liability Company)**
- Secretary of State filing: $70
- Annual franchise tax: $800 (due by 4/15)
- Personal liability protection
- Most popular for small businesses
- Processing: 2-3 business days online

**Corporation**
- Secretary of State filing: $100
- Annual franchise tax: $800 minimum
- Maximum liability protection
- More formalities required
- Processing: 2-3 business days online

**Partnership/LP**
- Filing required with Secretary of State
- Shared liability (unless Limited Partnership)
- More complex management
- Requires partner agreement

## Step 2: Register with California Secretary of State

## Step 3: File Fictitious Business Name (DBA)

**Cost**: $10-$50 depending on county (plus newspaper publication ~$75-$150)

**Find County Clerk**: 
- Search "[County Name] County Clerk" for location and online filing portal
- Many counties offer online filing and publication assistance

**Important**: Cannot conduct business under DBA name until filed and published

## Step 4: Obtain Federal EIN

**What It Is**: Employer Identification Number (federal tax ID)

**Required For**:
- All LLCs, Corporations, Partnerships
- Solo proprietors ONLY if hiring employees
- Some sole proprietors apply even without employees (recommended)

**What You'll Need**:
- Business legal name
- Business location address
- Business start date
- Type of business (NAICS code)
- Number of employees

**Note**: Even if you're sole proprietor and didn't get EIN, you'll get one later through CDTFA registration

## Documents to Organize Now

- [ ] Certified copy of Articles of Organization/Incorporation
- [ ] EIN assignment letter from IRS

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't**:

- Assume you can operate under DBA name before publishing notice
- Miss the 40-day DBA filing deadline
- Use home address for registered office without checking if residential addresses allowed
- Skip FBN filing and assume you're covered (not in all cases)
