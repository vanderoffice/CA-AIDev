## Step 4: SB 205 Stormwater Compliance (if applicable)

**Effective**: January 1, 2020
**Applies To**: Specific industries with stormwater discharge exposure

**Industries Requiring SB 205**:
- Industrial facilities (manufacturing, warehouses)
- Automotive repair/service facilities
- Construction-related businesses
- Landscape/gardening services (some)
- Equipment storage yards
- Metal fabrication, electronics, machinery

**Do You Need It**?
- If materials/equipment exposed to rainfall: YES
- If all materials covered/indoors: Probably NO
- Uncertain? Contact State Water Board: (866) 563-3107

**What to Do**:
1. Determine if your business type qualifies
2. If YES: Enroll in appropriate program
3. Get WDID number, application number, or certification
4. Prepare SB 205 Compliance Form
5. Submit with city/county business license application

**Enrollment Options**:
- Notice of Intent (NOI): For exposed industrial activities
- Notice of Non-Applicability (NONA): If exempt from rules
- No Exposure Certification (NEC): If covered/indoor only

**Portal**: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/sb205.html
**Tracking System**: SMARTS (Stormwater Multiple Application and Report Tracking System)

## Step 5: Nonprofit 501(c)(3) Considerations

**Important Clarification**: 501(c)(3) status does NOT eliminate licensing

**What IS Exempt** (with proof of 501(c)(3)):
- Business license FEES (not the license itself)
- Some income and property taxes
- Sales tax on qualifying transactions only

**What IS REQUIRED** (even with 501(c)(3)):
- Business license/tax certificate must still be obtained
- Statement of Information filing with SOS
- Compliance with zoning and other regulations
- Some cities may still charge fees despite exemption

**If You're Nonprofit**:
- Obtain IRS determination letter (proof of 501(c)(3))
- Keep copy with all licensing applications
- File Statement of Information annually with SOS
- Some jurisdictions honor fee exemptions, others don't (verify with city)

## Step 6: Industry-Specific State Licenses

**If applicable to your business**, reference @docs/industry-requirements.md for:
- Medical/healthcare licensing (CDPH, Medical Board)
- Alcohol sales (ABC license)
- Cannabis operations (Department of Cannabis Control)
- Construction (CSLB contractor license)
- Professional services (various boards)
- Other regulated industries

**Note**: Most industries require state license BEFORE city/county license

## Required Documents to Organize

- [ ] Secretary of State entity registration confirmation
- [ ] Statement of Information filing receipt
- [ ] CDTFA Seller's Permit confirmation (if applicable)
- [ ] SB 205 enrollment documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] 501(c)(3) determination letter (if nonprofit)
- [ ] State industry-specific licenses/permits (if applicable)
- [ ] EIN assignment letter (from Phase 1)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't**:
- Forget Statement of Information deadline ($250 penalty)
- Assume seller's permit not needed for online sales
- Overlook SB 205 requirements (triggers business license rejection in some cities)
- Assume nonprofit 501(c)(3) exempts you from licensing
- Miss LLCs need to file SOI every 2 years (not one-time)
- Start sales without seller's permit (penalties, back taxes)

## Processing Times

| Item | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Statement of Information | 1-2 weeks | File ASAP after formation |
| Seller's Permit | ~14 days | Apply immediately if needed |
| SB 205 enrollment | 5-10 days | Apply ASAP if applicable |
| State industry licenses | 1-12 weeks | Varies by industry (see industry-requirements.md) |

## Next Steps
