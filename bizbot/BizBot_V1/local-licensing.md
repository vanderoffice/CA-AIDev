# Phase 3: Local Licensing

Complete this phase during weeks 3-8. This is typically the longest phase (zoning clearance often takes 4-6 weeks).

## CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Zoning Clearance

**DO THIS FIRST**: Most cities require zoning clearance BEFORE business license application

**What It Verifies**:
- Your business use is allowed at that location
- No zoning violations
- Compliance requirements identified
- Certificate of Occupancy status

**Timeline**: 1-6 weeks (varies significantly by city)
**Cost**: Usually $25-$100
**Process**: Contact city Planning or Development Services Department

**How to Start**:
1. Get your property's Assessor's Parcel Number (APN) from county assessor
2. Contact city Planning Department
3. Provide property address and detailed business description
4. Pay verification fee
5. Receive written zoning clearance confirmation
6. KEEP THIS - required for business license application

**Contact Method** (varies by city):
- Online portals available in some cities
- In-person at Planning counter (check hours)
- Phone consultation
- Email application

**Note**: You cannot proceed to business license without zoning clearance

## Determine Your Jurisdiction

**Are you in a city or unincorporated area?**

**In City Limits**:
- Automatically subject to city business license requirements
- Contact city directly or search "[City Name] business license"
- Skip county section below

**In Unincorporated Area**:

- Still may need city permits if near city boundaries
- Verify jurisdiction: contact county or use county website map tool
