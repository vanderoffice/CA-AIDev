# Defining "Small Business" in California: A Comprehensive Framework

California law does **not have a single, unified definition of "small business."** Instead, the state maintains **over two dozen different definitions** across various codes, each tailored to specific regulatory, contracting, or tax contexts. This complexity requires any definition to specify its intended use case. Below is a synthesized framework based on deep research into California's statutory and regulatory landscape.[^1_1]

***

## Primary Definition: State Procurement and Certification

The most widely applicable definition for state government purposes is found in **Government Code § 14837** and implemented through **2 CCR § 1896.12** by the Department of General Services (DGS). As of **March 2024**, following the biennial Consumer Price Index adjustment, the current thresholds are:[^1_2][^1_3]

### Small Business (SB) Certification

A business qualifies as a "small business" for state certification if it meets **all** of the following criteria:

**Qualitative Requirements:**

- Independently owned and operated[^1_4]
- Not dominant in its field of operation[^1_4]
- Principal office located in California[^1_5]
- Owners, officers, members/managers, and/or partners domiciled in California[^1_5]

**Quantitative Thresholds (including affiliates):**

- **100 or fewer employees**, AND
- **Average gross annual receipts of \$18 million or less** over the previous three tax years[^1_3][^1_5]
- *Exception for manufacturers*: 100 or fewer employees with **no revenue cap**[^1_4]


### Microbusiness (MB) Designation

A certified small business automatically receives microbusiness designation if:[^1_5][^1_3]

- Average gross annual receipts are **\$6 million or less** (3-year average), OR
- It is a manufacturer with **25 or fewer employees**


### Small Business for Public Works (SB-PW)

For public works contracts and engineering services:[^1_5][^1_6]

- **200 or fewer employees**, AND
- **Average gross annual receipts of \$43 million or less** (3-year average)

***

## Rulemaking and Regulatory Impact Definition

**Government Code § 11342.610** provides a separate definition used to assess the impact of proposed state regulations on small businesses. This definition is **industry-specific** and generally more restrictive:[^1_7]


| Industry Sector | Revenue Threshold | Employee Threshold |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Agriculture | ≤\$1 million | — |
| General Construction | ≤\$9.5 million | — |
| Special Trade Construction | ≤\$5 million | — |
| Retail Trade | ≤\$2 million | — |
| Wholesale Trade | ≤\$9.5 million | — |
| Services | ≤\$2 million | — |
| Transportation/Warehousing | ≤\$1.5 million | — |
| Manufacturing | — | ≤250 employees |
| Healthcare Facility | ≤\$1.5 million OR ≤150 beds | — |
| Electric Power Generation | ≤4.5 million kWh/year | — |

This definition **explicitly excludes** certain business types regardless of size, including financial institutions, insurance companies, subdividers/developers, architects, nonprofits, entertainment production companies, and petroleum producers.[^1_7]

***

## Comparison with Federal SBA Standards

The U.S. Small Business Administration uses **industry-specific size standards** based on NAICS codes, typically measuring either average annual receipts (5-year average) or employee count (24-month average):[^1_8][^1_9]

- **Most non-manufacturing businesses**: Under \$7.5 million in average annual receipts[^1_10]
- **Most manufacturing businesses**: Under 500 employees[^1_10]
- Standards vary significantly by NAICS code—some industries allow up to \$40+ million in receipts or 1,500+ employees[^1_11]

California's state definitions are generally **more restrictive** than federal SBA standards for most industries, particularly for the rulemaking definition.[^1_1]

***

## Recommended Consolidated Definition

For government modernization, digital services, and cross-agency policy purposes, a **practical unified definition** should incorporate the core elements consistent across California law:

> **"Small Business" means a for-profit business entity that:**
>
> 1. **Is independently owned and operated** and not a subsidiary or affiliate of a larger enterprise that controls its operations
>
> 2. **Is not dominant** in its field of operation within California
>
> 3. **Has its principal office located in California** with owners or officers domiciled in the state
>
> 4. **Meets the applicable size thresholds:**
>    - **General standard**: 100 or fewer employees AND average annual gross receipts of \$18 million or less over the previous three tax years
>    - **Microbusiness**: 100 or fewer employees AND average annual gross receipts of \$6 million or less
>    - **Public works context**: 200 or fewer employees AND average annual gross receipts of \$43 million or less
>    - **Manufacturing exception**: 100 or fewer employees (no revenue cap for general; 25 or fewer for microbusiness)
>
> 5. **Performs a commercially useful function** by actually performing, managing, or supervising the work involved—not merely serving as a pass-through entity

***

## Key Implementation Considerations

**Threshold Adjustments**: The DGS Director conducts a **biennial review** of revenue thresholds and adjusts them based on changes to the California Consumer Price Index. The next adjustment is expected in early 2026.[^1_4][^1_2]

**Affiliate Counting**: Both employee counts and gross receipts must include all **affiliated businesses**—entities under common ownership or control, including those where an external party has 50% or more ownership.[^1_8][^1_12]

**Certification vs. Self-Declaration**: For state contracting preferences (5% bid preference), businesses must obtain **formal certification** from DGS's Office of Small Business and DVBE Services. For federal SBA programs, businesses can **self-certify** in SAM.gov but are subject to size protests.[^1_9][^1_13][^1_14]

**Context Matters**: Always specify which definition applies for a given use case. A business qualifying as "small" for procurement certification may not qualify under the rulemaking definition or for specific tax credits.[^1_1]

## California's Small Business Landscape

California is home to approximately **4.1 million small businesses**—the most of any state—comprising 99.9% of all businesses in the state. These businesses employ **7 million people**, representing 47.1% of California's private-sector workforce. Nearly half of these small businesses are owned by racially and ethnically diverse individuals, contributing \$414 billion annually to the state's economy.[^1_15][^1_16][^1_17][^1_18]
