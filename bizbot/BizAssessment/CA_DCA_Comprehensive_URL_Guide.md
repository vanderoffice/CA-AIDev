## Common Business Pain Points

Based on research conducted for the BizAssessment project:

1. **Finding the right board** - With 40+ boards, businesses often struggle to identify which board licenses their profession

2. **Inconsistent processes** - Each board has different requirements, forms, and timelines

3. **BreEZe usability issues** - The centralized system has known UX challenges

4. **Opaque application status** - Limited visibility into where applications are in the review process

5. **Missed renewals** - Continuing education tracking and renewal deadlines cause license lapses

6. **Processing backlogs** - Some boards (BRN, CSLB) have 10-12+ week processing times
