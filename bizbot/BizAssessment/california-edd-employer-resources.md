## Common Business Pain Points

Based on research conducted for the BizAssessment project:

1. **Worker misclassification** - Confusion about whether workers are employees or independent contractors, especially after AB 5

2. **Filing frequency confusion** - Understanding which payroll taxes to file and how often (quarterly vs. annually)

3. **Penalty surprises** - Learning about obligations only after receiving penalty notices

4. **Multi-state complexity** - Employers with workers in multiple states face overlapping requirements

5. **UI claims disputes** - Responding to unemployment claims and understanding benefit charges

6. **Registration timing** - Not registering promptly when hiring first employee
