## Mobile Food Facility Classifications

California classifies mobile food facilities into categories:

| Category | Description | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **A** | Prepackaged food only, whole produce, whole fish | Minimal permits |
| **B** | Limited prep (heating, frying, assembly) | Standard MFF permit |
| **C** | Stationary at single location, limited prep | Standard MFF permit |
| **D** | Full food preparation, hot holding | Full MFF permit, comprehensive plan check |

**Most food trucks are Category D** (full food prep).

## Compact Mobile Food Operations (CMFOs)

Senate Bill 972 (effective 1/1/2023) created a simpler path for small vendors:

**Exempt from Health Permits if ALL conditions met:**
- Non-motorized (push cart, stand, pedal cart)
- Less than 25 sq ft display space
- Sells ONLY prepackaged non-potentially-hazardous food OR whole uncut produce

**CMFO Advantages:**
- Can store at home with Home Storage Endorsement
- Cottage Food Operation can serve as commissary
- Startup costs: $5,000-15,000

### Insurance Tips

---

## Multi-County Operations

### Each County = Separate Permit

Your LA County permit does NOT work in:
- Orange County
- San Diego County
- Ventura County
- Any other county

### Multi-County Process

1. Get permit in primary county first
2. Use that permit as proof when applying to additional counties
3. Submit route sheets to EACH county
4. Pay fees in EACH county

### Commissary Constraint

**Critical:** You must return to ONE commissary daily

This limits how far you can practically operate from your base location.

## Common Reasons for Permit Denial

### 1. Missing Commissary Agreement
**Problem:** Applied without signed commissary agreement
**Solution:** Secure commissary FIRST, get written agreement

### 2. Non-Certified Equipment
**Problem:** Proposed home appliances or non-NSF equipment
**Solution:** All equipment must be ANSI/NSF certified

### 3. Incomplete Documentation
**Problem:** Missing plans, specs, or forms
**Solution:** Use county checklist, submit complete package

### 4. No HCD Certification
**Problem:** Vehicle not certified as Special Purpose Commercial Modular
**Solution:** Get HCD certification before health permit application

### 5. Zoning Violations
**Problem:** Planned locations don't allow food trucks
**Solution:** Research local restrictions FIRST

### 6. Missing Fire Safety Equipment
**Problem:** No UL 300 hood suppression, no extinguishers
**Solution:** Install required fire equipment before inspection
