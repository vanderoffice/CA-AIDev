## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Signing a Lease Before Zoning Verification
**Problem:** Locked into lease for a location where restaurants aren't permitted
**Solution:** Always get written zoning confirmation before signing

### 2. Underestimating ABC Timeline
**Problem:** Planning to open with alcohol but license takes 6+ months
**Solution:** Start ABC application immediately; plan soft opening without alcohol

### 3. Failing Plan Review
**Problem:** Health department rejects plans, delaying construction
**Solution:** Hire experienced restaurant architect; request pre-application meeting

### 4. Missing Food Handler Training
**Problem:** Employees working without valid cards → citation
**Solution:** Complete training before first shift; track expiration dates

### 5. Not Budgeting for Fire Suppression
**Problem:** Hood suppression systems cost $5,000-20,000
**Solution:** Include in construction budget from day one

### 6. Ignoring ADA Requirements
**Problem:** Accessibility violations are expensive to fix after opening
**Solution:** Hire architect familiar with ADA; include accessibility review in plan check
