## Regulatory Framework

### Department of Cannabis Control (DCC)

**Agency:** California Department of Cannabis Control
**URL:** https://cannabis.ca.gov
**Phone:** (844) 612-2322

**Formed:** July 1, 2021 (consolidated three former agencies)

### Dual Approval Pathway (CRITICAL)

**Step 1: Local Authorization (FIRST)**
- Obtain city or county cannabis business permit
- Each jurisdiction has different rules
- Some jurisdictions ban cannabis entirely
- Local approval is a PREREQUISITE for state license

**Step 2: State License (SECOND)**
- Apply to DCC only AFTER local approval
- Must provide proof of local authorization
- Cannot operate without BOTH licenses

**Timeline Warning:** Local approval can take 6-18 months depending on jurisdiction.
