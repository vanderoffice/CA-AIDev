## Common Business Pain Points

Based on research conducted for the BizAssessment project:

1. **Technical, complex applications** - Permit applications for elevators, pressure vessels, and cranes require engineering documentation

2. **Coordinating inspections** - Scheduling inspections and corrective actions can delay projects

3. **Permit awareness gaps** - Many businesses don't realize certain equipment or activities require DIR permits

4. **Renewal/re-inspection triggers** - Uncertainty about when renewals or re-inspections are required

5. **Workers' comp complexity** - Understanding insurance requirements and self-insurance options

6. **Prevailing wage compliance** - Public works contractor registration and certified payroll requirements
