## Applied Fixes (2026-02-15 Audit Remediation)

### Dead URLs Replaced

| Old URL | New URL | Files Fixed |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [OLD] cslb.ca.gov/About_Us/Library/Licensing_Timeframes.aspx | https://www.cslb.ca.gov/onlineservices/processingtimes/processingtimes.aspx | CSLB_Licensing_Guide.md (×2) |
| [OLD] cslb.ca.gov/Licensees/Renew_A_License.aspx | https://www.cslb.ca.gov/contractors/maintain_license/renew_license/ | CA_DCA_Comprehensive_URL_Guide.md |
| [OLD] dgs.ca.gov/DSA/Resources/CASp-Program | https://www.dgs.ca.gov/DSA/Certifications/Page-Content/CASp-Certification | General_Retail_Guide.md |
| [OLD] onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov/_/ | https://cdtfa.ca.gov/services/ | url_validator.py, create_url_database.py |
| [OLD] ca.metrc.com | https://www.metrc.com/partner/california/ | Cannabis_Licensing_Guide.md (×2) |

### Redirect URLs Updated to Canonical Destinations

| Old URL | Canonical URL | Files Fixed |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| [OLD] fda.gov/food/registration-food-facilities | https://www.fda.gov/food/registration-food-facilities-and-other-submissions/online-registration-food-facilities | Manufacturing_Licensing_Guide.md |
| [OLD] irs.gov/.../apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online | https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/get-an-employer-identification-number | Entity_Types_Decision_Matrix.md, Manufacturing_Licensing_Guide.md, Restaurant_Licensing_Guide.md |

### Redirects NOT Fixed (by design)

| Category | Count | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| FTB `/index.html` paths | 14 | Not redirecting — FTB serves index.html directly (returns 200). Removing index.html returns 503. |
| `http://` academic papers | 13 | External academic references (SSRN, Springer, Emerald). Not CA gov URLs. Most don't support HTTPS. |
| `.aspx` URLs (CDPH, Sacramento County) | ~8 | Still serving .aspx paths with 200. No redirect occurring. |
