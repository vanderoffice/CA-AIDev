# I am conducting stakeholder interviews with California State departments that are involved in business formation, permitting, licensing, and license renewal.

Conduct deep research to identify every California State department, agency, board, or commission that has any role in:

Starting a business (entity formation, tax registration, permits, or professional/occupational licensing), or
Maintaining or renewing a business license, permit, registration, or professional credential in California.

For each identified department:

Provide a concise narrative (2–4 paragraphs) describing how that department interacts with:

Members of the public (prospective and existing business owners, professionals) as part of business creation, compliance, and renewal processes.
Other state or local agencies as part of those processes (e.g., data sharing, referrals, coordinated reviews).

Emphasize touchpoints, channels, and artifacts, such as:
Online portals, call centers, email, in‑person counters, mailed forms.
Typical forms, data systems, workflows, and approval or review steps that a business or licensee must go through.

For each department, draft 5 sharp, open‑ended interview questions that:
Help uncover operational pain points, bottlenecks, and failure modes inside the department (e.g., manual work, legacy systems, backlogs, data quality, policy constraints).
Reveal the most common frustrations and confusion experienced by the public when interacting with that department.

Specifically probe where agentic AI, automation, or process redesign could:
Reduce workload and turnaround times.
Improve clarity, guidance, and self‑service.
Improve data quality, compliance, and cross‑agency coordination.

When drafting questions:
Avoid technical jargon; phrase questions so they are comfortable for program, operations, and front‑line staff.
Make questions specific enough to elicit concrete examples (systems, forms, policies, queues, hand‑offs) rather than abstract opinions.

Where relevant, include at least one question about:
Data availability and quality.
Policy or statutory barriers to streamlining.
Opportunities for pilots or “low‑risk experiments” using AI or automation.

The overall goal is to generate department‑specific interview guides that will help map the current business licensing and renewal ecosystem in California, identify systemic issues for both agencies and the public, and surface high‑leverage opportunities for agentic AI and other process‑streamlining technologies to improve outcomes.

California’s business creation and licensing ecosystem centers on a small set of high‑impact state departments that almost every employer or licensed professional must touch: the Secretary of State, tax and payroll agencies, and the professional licensing system under the Department of Consumer Affairs. The prompts below give you department‑specific interview guides for four of the most critical players; additional agencies like GO‑Biz/CalOSBA, Alcoholic Beverage Control, the Department of Cannabis Control, DIR/Cal‑OSHA, Insurance, and Health should be added in a second wave of interviews.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6]

## Secretary of State – Business Programs (BizFile)

The Secretary of State’s Business Programs Division is the front door for forming corporations, LLCs, and limited partnerships, processing millions of filings and information requests each year. Members of the public interact primarily through the BizFile online portal for name reservations, entity formation, and certificates, but can also submit mailed forms or visit counters, often getting referred onward to tax and permitting agencies via resources like CalGOLD and GO‑Biz. The division also serves other agencies by providing authoritative entity data (legal name, status, ID number), which downstream systems like EDD registration and tax accounts rely on to validate businesses.[^1_2][^1_4][^1_7][^1_1]

- When someone forms a new business through BizFile or by mail, at what specific steps do applications most often get delayed, rejected, or bounced back, and what are the usual root causes (missing documents, name issues, system limits, staff capacity)?
- Thinking about a typical week, where do your staff spend the most time on manual work (data entry from paper, status checks, back‑and‑forth with filers, reissuing documents), and how does that impact turnaround time during peak periods?
- From your perspective, what parts of the process are most confusing for the public (choosing an entity type, understanding follow‑on registrations, correcting defects), even when they have access to your online guidance and help lines?
- What challenges do you face in maintaining accurate, up‑to‑date entity records (e.g., dissolutions, address changes) and in making that data easy for other departments and local governments to consume reliably?
- If you could run a low‑risk pilot using AI or automation, which part of the entity lifecycle (pre‑filing guidance, intake triage, defect detection, status communications) would you target first, and how would you know it was reducing staff workload without increasing risk or errors?


## California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA)

CDTFA administers sales and use tax and a range of special taxes and fees, and it issues seller’s permits and related tax accounts that many retail and service businesses must obtain before operating. Businesses can apply online via CDTFA’s registration system—which guides them through selecting permit types and collecting business, owner, and reference information—or visit field offices in person, with many applicants receiving permits immediately after submitting. CDTFA also coordinates with GO‑Biz and other state resources so that permit seekers can discover their obligations via centralized “how to start a business” and permit‑assistance content.[^1_8][^1_9][^1_10][^1_1]

- When applicants register online for seller’s permits or other tax programs, which parts of the application (questions, document uploads, system flows) generate the most help calls, abandoned applications, or corrections from staff?
- Where in your current workflows—whether in field offices or back‑office processing—are staff rekeying data, reconciling conflicting records, or manually checking other systems before approving or updating a permit?
- From what you see in calls, emails, and walk‑ins, what are the most common misunderstandings businesses have about when they need a seller’s permit, how to report sales, or how CDTFA relates to other tax agencies?
- How confident are you in the quality and completeness of business account data (e.g., NAICS codes, locations, responsible parties), and what issues arise when that data is shared or compared with information from the Secretary of State, EDD, or local jurisdictions?
- If you could test AI or automation in a narrow, low‑risk way, would you prioritize smarter self‑service guidance (e.g., interactive triage before registration), automated defect detection in applications, or internal decision‑support for staff—and what outcomes would you want to measure?


## Employment Development Department (EDD) – Employer Payroll Tax Accounts

EDD registers employers for payroll tax accounts and provides online services for filing wage reports, paying payroll taxes, and managing employer accounts. Employers register through “e‑Services for Business,” a 24/7 portal that walks them through enrollment and then account registration, requiring details like the legal business name and Secretary of State ID to align with state business‑entity records. EDD’s employer database and wage reporting systems are core infrastructure for unemployment insurance and disability insurance programs, and they interact indirectly with other tax and business‑registration agencies that rely on the same underlying business identifiers.[^1_11][^1_7][^1_12]

- When new employers enroll and register through e‑Services for Business, at what points do they most often get stuck or need staff help (e.g., account activation emails, SOS ID matching, understanding which taxes apply), and how do you currently track those pain points?
- In your day‑to‑day operations, where are staff still heavily dependent on manual reviews, duplicate data entry, or ad‑hoc workarounds (spreadsheets, personal notes) to move registrations or adjustments to completion?
- Based on your experience with calls and inquiries, what are the most frequent sources of confusion for employers around their ongoing obligations—filing schedules, wage reporting formats, closing or re‑opening accounts, or interactions with other tax agencies?
- How would you characterize the accuracy and completeness of employer and wage data in your systems, and what kinds of data issues (e.g., mismatched identifiers, stale addresses, inconsistent classifications) most often create downstream problems for employers or for other agencies?
- If you could pilot an AI‑enabled assistant or workflow, where would it have the biggest immediate impact—guiding employers through registration, triaging inbound questions, flagging likely errors in wage reports, or helping staff navigate legacy systems more efficiently?


## Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) – Professional \& Occupational Licensing

The Department of Consumer Affairs houses about 40 boards, bureaus, and related entities that license more than 100 business and over 200 professional categories, from contractors and cosmetologists to medical and design professions. Many of these entities use DCA’s BreEZe online system to let applicants and licensees apply, renew, update information, and look up license status, with tutorials and public search tools supporting both licensees and consumers. DCA’s licensee databases and public lookup tools are accessed by employers, local governments, and other state entities (for example, for hiring, enforcement, or cross‑checks), making DCA a key node in the broader business‑licensing ecosystem.[^1_3][^1_13][^1_14][^1_15][^1_16][^1_17]

- For your board or bureau specifically, which steps in the application and renewal processes (whether in BreEZe or via paper) tend to generate the longest queues, the most rework, or the highest volume of status inquiries from licensees?
- Where do staff feel the greatest friction from technology—such as limitations of BreEZe, reliance on separate spreadsheets or databases, or difficulty pulling reports needed for management, enforcement, or legislative requests?
- From what you hear in calls, emails, and complaints, what aspects of your licensing requirements or online experience are most confusing for applicants and licensees (e.g., education documentation, exam scheduling, continuing education, timing of renewals)?
- How complete and reliable is the licensing data you maintain (including specialties, practice locations, discipline history), and what challenges arise when other entities—like employers, local governments, or other state agencies—try to use or interpret that data?
- If you could run a tightly scoped experiment with AI or automation, where would you focus first: smarter pre‑application guidance, automated screening for incomplete or high‑risk applications, improved self‑service for renewals, or tools that help staff quickly navigate and reconcile information across systems?


## Cross‑Agency Context and Coordination Opportunities

State small‑business resources highlight a core cluster of permitting and tax agencies—Secretary of State, Franchise Tax Board, EDD, Department of Industrial Relations, and CDTFA—as primary touchpoints, and refer businesses to CalGOLD and GO‑Biz to discover additional state and local permits. These cross‑agency portals and guidance sites already act as informal integration points, surfacing links and contact information for licensing entities while leaving businesses to navigate multiple uncoordinated systems, logins, and vocabularies.[^1_4][^1_1]

- Across the agencies you interact with most often, where do you see the biggest gaps or breakdowns in hand‑offs—such as inconsistent terminology, duplicate data collection, or unclear referrals that force businesses to start over?
- What data about businesses or licensees do you most often wish you could see from another department in real time, and what legal, policy, or technical barriers prevent that from happening today?
- When statutes or regulations prescribe specific forms, signatures, or in‑person steps, which of those requirements feel most out of date or most clearly block opportunities to streamline with digital or automated workflows?
- Can you describe any past or current pilots that tried to simplify cross‑agency processes (for example, shared portals, data‑sharing agreements, or joint reviews), and what you learned about what does and doesn’t work in practice?
- If you had support to design a low‑risk cross‑agency AI or automation experiment, which journey would you choose first (e.g., “start a restaurant,” “hire your first employee,” “get a professional license”), and which concrete outcomes—like fewer touchpoints, faster approvals, or fewer errors—would matter most to you?
