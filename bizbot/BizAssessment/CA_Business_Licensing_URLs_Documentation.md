## AI Agent Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Always verify URL currency** - Government websites change; verify links are current before providing to users.

2. **Provide context** - Include the department name and description when sharing URLs so users understand what they're accessing.

3. **Use appropriate category** - Match user needs to URL category:
   - "How do I apply?" → Application URLs
   - "How much does it cost?" → Fees URLs
   - "Is this business licensed?" → Search URLs
   - "What are the requirements?" → Guide URLs

4. **Include contact information** - When appropriate, provide the phone number along with the URL in case users need assistance.
