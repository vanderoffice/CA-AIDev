## Common Business Pain Points

Based on research conducted for the BizAssessment project:

1. **Surprise at $800 minimum tax** - Many new LLC and corporation owners don't realize they owe the minimum franchise tax even with zero income in the first year

2. **Nexus confusion** - Uncertainty about what triggers "doing business" in California and requires filing

3. **Estimated payment requirements** - Missing quarterly estimates leading to penalties

4. **Discovery after penalties** - Learning about obligations only after receiving penalty notices

5. **SOS/FTB coordination** - Not understanding that Secretary of State suspension blocks tax accounts and vice versa
