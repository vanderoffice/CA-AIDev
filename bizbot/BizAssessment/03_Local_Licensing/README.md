## Critical Principle: ZONING FIRST

**Before applying for ANY business license, verify zoning allows the business use.**

Common zoning issues:
- Residential zones may prohibit commercial activity
- Home occupations have strict limits
- Retail in industrial zones may be prohibited
- Cannabis has special zoning requirements
