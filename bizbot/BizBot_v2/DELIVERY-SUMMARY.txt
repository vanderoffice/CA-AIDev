MULTI-AGENT PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED:

1. Sequential Waterfall (Startup Path)
   Entity → State → Location → Industry → Compliance
   (Each phase depends on prior phase outputs)

2. Conditional Branching (Renewal Path)
   Skip Entity/State → Location → Industry → Compliance
   (For existing businesses)

3. Parallel Processing (Output Generation)
   PDF Gen + Email Send + Log Tracking
   (Run simultaneously for efficiency)
